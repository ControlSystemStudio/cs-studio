        <h1>Scan Server DataSource</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The Scan Server DataSource allows select access to the CS-Studio Scan Server API through pvmanager.
        Access to the datasource depends on a plugin's dependence to pvmanager (BOY, probe, etc.).
        Submitting a scan is not supported in the datasource, as a diirt service is a better fit.
        </p>
        <p>Refer to Help Contents -> CSS Applications -> Scan Server
        for a more detailed description of the Scan Server system</p>

        <h2>PV syntax</h2>
        <p>
        The standard prefix for the datasource is <code>scan://</code> which can be omitted if configured as the default datasource.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
            scan://localscan VTable of infos 1000 max entries (percent complete, start time, etc.)
            scan://localscan?max=5 VTable of infos (percent complete, start time, etc.)
            scan://localscan/1 VTable of specific scan info
            scan://localscan/1/data VTable of scan data
            scan://localscan/1/devices VTable of devices used in scan (null entries if the state is "Logged")
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Writes are allowed for the <code>scan://localscan/1</code> request with strings to control the specific scan</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        	"pause"
        	"resume"
        	"abort"
        	"remove"
        </code>
        </pre>

        <h2>XML Config</h2>
        <p>Configuration follows the "diirt" configuration.  A "scan" directory/file needs to be placed in your configuration directory ie. .diirt/datasources/scan/scan.xml.
        Below is an example.  The Scan Server has a REST API which is polled at "pollInterval", and a "timeout" on that connection.
        The "name" will be the alias to the defined "url".</p>
        <pre><xmp>
			<scan version="1">
			  <servers pollInterval="2" timeout="10">
			    <server name="localscan" url="http://localhost:4810/">
			    </server>
			  </servers>
			</scan>
		</xmp>
        </pre>
