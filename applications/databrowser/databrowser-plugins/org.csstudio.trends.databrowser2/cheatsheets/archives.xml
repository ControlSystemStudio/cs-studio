<description>
When adding Process Variables to a new Data Browser plot, historic
data for them will be fetched from default Archive Data Sources that
were configured for your site.
<br/>
In some cases you want to change this on a per-PV basis because you
need to fetch data from an Archive Data Source other than the default.
<br/>
The following steps explain how to change what archive data sources are used
to locate 'historic' samples for a PV.

</intro>


<item title="Initial Scenario">
<description>
We assume you have a plot with some PVs open.
You also see the "Properties" and "Archive Search" panels.
<br/>
If not, follow the cheat sheets
"Plot Archived Data" respectively
"Reset Data Browser Perspective".
</description>
</item>


<item title="Determine archive configuration">
<description>
Click on the Plot, then on the "Traces" tab in the "Properties" panel.
You should see a list of Item names.
<br/>
Click on an Item name, and the "Archive Data Sources" section below
the list of items will show the currently used archive data sources.
</description>
</item>


<item title="Add Archive Data Source">
<description>
In the "Properties" panel, "Traces" tab, left-click on an Item name to select it.
Depending on the operating system, you can click while holding
the Shift, Control, Command, or Alt keys to select multiple
Items in the list.
<br/>
Right-click on a selected item, pick "Add Archive Data Source"
to open a dialog that allows you to pick an Archive Data Server URL,
then one or more of the sub-archives provided by that data server.
<br/>
Alternatively, you can drag-and-drop sub-archives from the "Archive Search" panel
onto an Item name in the "Properties" panel.
</description>
</item>


<item title="Delete Archive Data Source">
<description>
In the "Properties" panel, "Traces" tab, "Archive Data Sources" section,
right-click on an archive data source from which you don't want a PV Item
to read archived data, and select "Remove Archive Data Source".
