<h1>E-Mail Support</h1>

The CSS E-Mail support library allows tools to send electronic mails with
optional text and image attachments.
<p>
For example, the Data Browser can email a screen-shot of the current plot. 

<h2>Preferences</h2>
There is only one configuration item:
<ul>
<li>SMTP Host:<br>
    Must be set to the name of your SMTP host, i.e. a server that can
    distribute e-mails.
    <br>
    When left empty, e-mail support is disabled.
</ul>
