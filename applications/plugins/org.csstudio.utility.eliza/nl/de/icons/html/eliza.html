<h1>CSS Therapist</h1>
The control system environment can present unique stress factors to operators.
At times it might be helpful to have a psychiatrist in the control room,
but that is often impractical.
<p>
In the mid twentieth century, Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum created the well-known
"ELIZA" program. It acts like a Rogerian therapist, returning statements based
on the user's input.
Due to the general naivete of some users, ELIZA actually fooled some of them
into thinking she was a flesh and bone therapist.
When Dr. Weizenbaum noticed how reality could be simulated by a
computational device, he denounced his own project in fear of how advances
in ELIZA-style code could negatively affect mankind.

<b>So try it, but don't rely on it. It's a joke, get it?</b>
