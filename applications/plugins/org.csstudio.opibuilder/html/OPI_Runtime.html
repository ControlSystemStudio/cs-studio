<h2>OPI Runtime</h2>
<p>
OPI Runtime is responsible for executing and managing OPI files.
<p>

</p>
</p> 
<h3>Run OPI from Navigator</h3>
<p>By default, you can run an .opi file by double-clicking it in the Navigator. 
If it's not opened in runtime, you can still open an .opi file with OPI Runtime by right clicking the file and choose Open With->OPI Runtime. 
</p>

<h3>Run OPI from command line</h3>

<p>
When you startup css from command line, you can specify the OPI files you want to run and their macros input:

<pre class="example_code">css --launcher.openFile "&lt;path_to_opi&gt;/file1.opi macro1=value1, macro2=value2" "&lt;path_to_opi2&gt;/file2.opi"
</pre>

<p>For more details: see <a href="Macro.html#commandLine">Input macros from command line</a>.</p>

<p>It also supports open an OPI in a specific position using <code>Position</code> macro as in Top OPIs preference.
See <a href="PreferencePage.html#topopis">Top OPIs Preference</a>. 
For example, this will open an OPI as a detached view:

<pre class="example_code">css --launcher.openFile "&lt;path_to_opi&gt;/file1.opi macro1=value1, Position=Detached"
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Top OPIs</h3>
<p>There is a <code>Top OPIs</code> drop-down button on toolbar, on which you can define which OPIs to open from preference page. This is very useful for a site if you have 
a "map" opi. In BOY, you can use URL path at everywhere if a path is needed. For example, if you set
a URL path <code>http://www.xxx.com/main.opi</code> for the top OPIs in preference page, you will be able
to run this OPI directly from Top OPIs button.</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="Top OPIs" src="./img/top_opis.png"/>
<br>
"Top OPIs" button in toolbar, in this example offering "main.opi" and other display files
</div>

<h3>Open OPI in Tab, Window or View</h3>
<p>OPI Runtime works like a modern web browser. It arrange OPIs in Tabs by default. 
Each tab can be rearranged by dragging it to a new place or new window.
By default, <code>Open OPI</code> action will replace the current OPI with the new OPI. 
But <code>Ctrl-Cliking</code> a widget with <code>Open OPI</code> action attached will open the OPI in a new Tab. 
Or in a new window by <code>Shift-Cliking</code>

If the current OPI is replace with new OPI, you can still go back or go forward from Navigation buttons on toolbar.
</p>

<p>OPI can also be opened in a View or a detached View (which looks like a standalone OPI window). 
See <a href="Actions.html">Actions.</a></p>

<h3>Context Menu</h3>
<p>
In contrast to standalone control system display managers, BOY is integrated in CSS, meaning:
You can open a context menu on any widget in a BOY display and send the PV that is displayed
by the widget to other CSS tools. For example, you can send the PV to the Data Browser to see
a strip-chart of the PV's value over time.
</p>

<p>If you have Elog or Email plugin installed, you will be able to send the OPI screen shot to 
Elog or an Email address.</p>

<p>Compact Mode will have menu bar and toolbar hidden. You can always exit compact mode by selecting
"Exit Compact Mode". Similar to Full Screen Mode.</p>

<h3>Zoom In/Out</h3>
<p>
You can zoom in/out from toolbar or by <code>Ctrl-Scrolling</code>.
