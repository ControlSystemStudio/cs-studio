    <h2>
      Action
    </h2>
    <p>
	 Actions can be attached to any widget so that actions can be executed from that widget. 
	 They are configured from the <code>Actions</code> Property. 
	 There are several types of actions that can be associated with any type of widget. You may also add
      customzied action through Eclipse plugin mechanism.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Open OPI</b> <dl><dd>Open a related OPI. If <code>Repalce</code> is selected, it will replace
      the current OPI. You can send macros to the OPI to be opened by setting the <code>Macros</code>
      property.   If a widget has this action hooked to its mouse
      click event, user will also be able to open the related OPI from its context menu: 
      <code>Open</code>, <code>Open in New Tab</code> or <code>Open in New Window</code>. Or user can 
      hold the <code>Ctrl</code>/<code>Shift</code> key while clicking on the widget 
      to open the related OPI in new Tab/Window.</dd></dl>
      </li>
      <li><b>Open OPI in View</b><dl><dd>Open an OPI in view. The view can be place in five possible positions:
       Left, Right, Top, Bottom or Detached.
      An undetached View can also be detached as standalone window floating on top by right clicking
      the view tab and click <code>Detached</code>. By clicking <code>Detached</code> again, you can
      put it back to the workbench window.</dd></dl></li>
      
      <li><b>Write PV</b> 
      <dl><dd>Write a PV. If the widget is a button, it is recommended to set the PV name in the "PV Name" 
      property of the widget, and use $(pv_name) as PV Name of the action. This will allow the PV getting connected
      on OPI startup instead of connecting to it on each write.
      If <code>Confirm Message</code> is not empty, a confirm dialog will pop up before writing the new value to PV.
          
      </dd></dl>
      
      </li>
      <li> <b>Execute Command</b> <dl><dd>
      Execute system command just as executing command from shell or command line on Windows.
      The command should be searchable from system PATH, otherwise, it should be a full path to the command.
      The output will be displayed in the console if there is. The property "Command Directory" is where the command
      will be executed. In most cases, you can just use the default directory which is user's home directory. The
      macro is a system property. It also has a special macro <code>$(opi.dir)</code> which points to the directory of the OPI file on the OS file system. 
      </dd></dd></dl>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Execute JavaScript</b><dl><dd>Execute a Javascript file, in which there are two
      accessible objects: <code>widget</code> and <code>display</code> so that you can 
      access the widget or the display. See <a href="script/AccessWidget.html">Access Widget</a></dd></dl>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Execute Python Script</b><dl><dd>Execute a Python script file, in which there are two
      accessible objects: <code>widget</code> and <code>display</code> so that you can 
      access the widget or the display. See <a href="script/AccessWidget.html">Access Widget</a></dd></dl>
      </li>
      <li><b>Play WAV file</b> <dl><dd>Play a sound file in WAV format.</dd></dl></li>
      <li><b>Open File</b> <dl><dd>Open a file with the default editor. 
      For example, you can open a databrowser file in databrowser. </dd></dl> </li>     
     
      <li><b>Open Webpage</b> <dl><dd>Open a webpage in system default web browser.</dd></dl>
      </li>
      </ul> 
      
      <h3>Configure Actions</h3>
      <p>Actions are configured from the <code>Actions</code> property of widget. The first 
      action can be hooked with the mouse click event, which means clicking on the widget at Runtime
      will execute the first action.
      </p>

      <h3>Invoke Action at Runtime</h3>
     <p>At Runtime, you can execute an action by right clicking on the widget and selecting the action from
      <code>Actions</code> submenu. If you selected the option <code>
      Hook the first action to the mouse click event on widget</code> in
      the actions config dialog, you can simply execute the first action by clicking on the widget.
    </p>

	<p>Actions may also be invoked from script by calling the method
	 <a href="script/AccessWidget.html#executeAction(int)">executeAction</a>.
	For example:
	<pre class="example_code">widget.executeAction(0); //execute the first attached action</pre>	
	</p>
