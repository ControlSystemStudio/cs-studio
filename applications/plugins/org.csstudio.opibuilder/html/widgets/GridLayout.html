    <h2>
      Grid Layout
    </h2>
    
    <p>A virtual widget (widget with no figure at runtime) that helps to automatically
    layout widgets in a container in grids. The width of a grid is determined by 
    the widget with largest width in the same column. The height of a grid is determined by
    the widget with largest height in the same row.
     Layout widget is always on top of other widgets and its
    position is always on left top corner. Its size is not changeable.
    A container can have only one layout widget.  
    </p>
    <p>If you have a script generated OPI, you make take advantage of this widget to layout the widgets
    automatically so that you don't need to specify the position and size of every widget in your script.</p>
