    <h2>
      Linking Container
    </h2>
    <p>Linking container can be used to embed another OPI or a group in another OPI in it.
    It is very useful by using it properly. For example, it can be used for animation by loading
    different content with a rule or script. Combined with different macros, you can show different PVs
    with same OPI.
