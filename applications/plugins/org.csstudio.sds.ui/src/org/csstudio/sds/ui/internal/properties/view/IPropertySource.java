/**
 * Interface to an object which is capable of supplying properties for display
 * by the standard property sheet page implementation (<code>PropertySheetPage</code>).
 * <p>
 * This interface should be implemented by clients.
 * <code>PropertySheetPage</code> discovers the properties to display from
 * currently selected elements. Elements that implement
 * <code>IPropertySource</code> directly are included, as are elements that
 * implement <code>IAdaptable</code> and have an <code>IPropertySource</code>
 * adapter. Clients should implement this interface for any newly-defined
 * elements that are to have properties displayable by
 * <code>PropertySheetPage</code>. Note that in the latter case, the client
 * will also need to register a suitable adapter factory with the platform's
 * adapter manager (<code>Platform.getAdapterManager</code>).

	/**
	 * Returns a value for this property source that can be edited in a property
	 * sheet.
	 * <p>
	 * This value is used when this <code>IPropertySource</code> is appearing
	 * in the property sheet as the value of a property of some other
	 * <code>IPropertySource</code>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This value is passed as the input to a cell editor opening on an
	 * <code>IPropertySource</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This value is also used when an <code>IPropertySource</code> is being
	 * used as the value in a <code>setPropertyValue</code> message. The
	 * reciever of the message would then typically use the editable value to
	 * update the original property source or construct a new instance.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * For example an email address which is a property source may have an
	 * editable value which is a string so that it can be edited in a text cell
	 * editor. The email address would also have a constructor or setter that
	 * takes the edited string so that an appropriate instance can be created or
	 * the original instance modified when the edited value is set.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This behavior is important for another reason. When the property sheet is
	 * showing properties for more than one object (multiple selection), a
	 * property sheet entry will display and edit a single value (typically
	 * coming from the first selected object). After a property has been edited
	 * in a cell editor, the same value is set as the property value for all of
	 * the objects. This is fine for primitive types but otherwise all of the
	 * objects end up with a reference to the same value. Thus by creating an
	 * editable value and using it to update the state of the original property
	 * source object, one is able to edit several property source objects at
	 * once (multiple selection).

	 * <p>

	 * value of property may be a type that cannot be edited with a standard
	 * cell editor. However instead of returning the real value in

	 * <p>
	 * Another variation on returning a value other than the real property value
	 * in <code>getPropertyValue</code> is to return a value which is an
	 * <code>IPropertySource</code> (or for which the property sheet can
	 * obtain an <code>IPropertySource</code>). In this case the value to
	 * edit is obtained from the child property source using
	 * <code>getEditableValue</code>. It is this editable value that will be
