<h2><a name=overview>Overview</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<p>
The Alarm System allow users to view and handle the alarms triggered by
Process Variables (PVs) on front-end computers (IOCs).
To understand the behavior of alarms in the alarm system,
please take a few minutes to read about its general principles.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
Alarms are <u>not</u> another interlock or protection system. Unlike interlocks,
alarms do not trigger an automated response to handle a well understood situation.
Instead, alarms inform operators of a problem that can have multiple reasons,
a problem that is too complex to be handled automatically,
an issue that <u>relies on a qualified operator</u>
to find a solution based on experience and skill.
</p>
<p>
Alarms are supposed to
<ul>
<li>notify operators about a problem</li>
<li>effectively help operators take the correct action
    at the correct time,</li>
<li>provide guidance for handling it</li>
<li>be presented at a manageable rate.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Operators are expected to acknowledge each active alarm, because the
alarm system has no other way of knowing if operators are aware
of an alarm. Annunciations for new occurrences of the same alarm are
suppressed until the initial alarm is acknowledged, assuming that
operators are still handling the first, un-acknowledged alarm instance.
</p>
<p>
Before acknowledging an alarm, operators can use the alarm GUI to 
<ul>
<li>access guidance on how to handle the alarm</li>
<li>access operator screens that show the actual alarm PV, the reason why it went into alarm</li>
<li>use the Data Browser or other tools to inspect the alarm or related PVs</li>
<li>access operator screens that allow them to handle the alarm</li>
<li>make an E-Log entry</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name=principles>General Alarm Principles</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h3>Where are alarms generated?</h3>
<p>
Alarms are triggered by Process Variables (PVs) on the front-end computers (IOCs).
Adding these <u>Trigger PVs</u> to the alarm server configuration generates
the actual alarms with an alarm description, guidance information,
and links to related operator displays or web pages. 
</p>

<h3>Alarm Severity and Status Message</h3>
<p>
Levels of severity can help users to prioritize their work,
especially when many alarms occur at the same time.
</p>
<p>
There are four alarm severity levels:
<ul>
<li><font color="#00FF00">OK</font> - actually meaning that there is no alarm</li>
<li><font color="#A0A000">MINOR</font> - low severity</li>
<li><font color="#FF0000">MAJOR</font> - higher severity</li>
<li><font color="#FF00FF">INVALID</font> - highest severity</li>
</ul>
The INVALID severity indicates a control system problem: The PV has no known value.
On an operational machine, not knowing the true state of the system can be
very bad, hence the highest alarm severity. On maintenance days, INVALID alarms
can be the result of equipment simply being turned off, i.e. not a severe
problem. The maintenance mode described below can help with that situation.
</p>

<p>
The severity of an alarm is provided by the control system trigger PV.
It needs to be configured by the IOC engineer.
</p>
<p>
In addition, each Trigger PV provides an alarm message (status) for each alarm.
This message can indicate if the alarm is caused by some value being too high
or too low, but it cannot replace the more elaborate guidance information that
needs to be configured within the alarm system user interface.
</p>


<h3>Alarm Severity/Status vs. Current Severity/Status</h3>
<p>
There are two types of severity and status for each alarm trigger:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Current Severity" and "Current Status" are directly read from the alarm trigger PV,
     representing its current severity and status that you would also see
     on other operator screens that happen to display this PV.
<li>"Alarm Severity" and the "Alarm Status" are the severity and status of the
     most severe event that the alarm server observed for the PV.
     When the alarm is configured to "latch", the alarm server remembers the
     highest alarm severity of the PV until it is manually acknowledged.
</ul>
<p>
The "Alarm Severity" can differ from the "Current Severity" when the underlying alarm PV
already recovered but the alarm server was configured to "latch" the alarm
until operator acknowledgement.
</p>

<a name=AlarmState>
<h3>Alarm States</h3>
</a>
<img class="float" alt="Alarm State Diagram for Latched PV" src="latched.png" />
<img class="float" alt="Alarm State Diagram for Un-Latched PV" src="unlatched.png" />
<p>
Fundamentally, an alarm can have 3 states:
<ul>
<li><font color="#00FF00">OK</font><br>
    There is no alarm. The trigger PV's severity is and has been OK.
</li>
<li><font color="#FF0000">Active Alarm</font><br>
    The trigger PV's severity changed to not-OK.
    The alarm is displayed in the alarm system user interface, showing the time
    and value of the original occurrence, waiting for an operator to analyze
    and fix the problem. 
</li>
<li><font color="#FF8080">Acknowledged Alarm</font><br>
    An operator has acknowledged the alarm.
    While the PV's severity might still be not-OK, the alarm system user interface
    shows that the alarm is being handled.
    Once the trigger PV returns to OK, the alarm reverts to the "OK" state.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In reality, alarms are more complicated because of their very nature.
If the reason for an alarm was known, it could have been fixed long ago, or
automated countermeasures would have been implemented.
But an alarm is an alarm because it requires human intelligence to analyze
and handle it.
Therefore alarm trigger PVs will sometimes go in and out of alarm for some time,
or only show a brief alarm which seems to recover on its own.
One purpose of the alarm system is to catch even brief alarms, and to reduce
the noise from alarms that cycle between OK and some alarm state.
</p>
<p>
Alarm are typically configured to "latch" and behave as shown in the first
state diagram.
Assume that the alarm is initially OK.
As soon as an alarm trigger PV sends for example a MINOR alarm severity,
the alarm system will latch the time and value of that occurrence and display
the alarm in the user interface.
If the alarm was configured for annunciation, the alarm description will be
annunciated.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, an operator investigates the alarm, fixes the underlying reason,
acknowledges the alarm, the PV returns to OK and the alarm clears.
In reality, other things can happen.
The PV might only cause a brief nuisance trip, then quickly return to OK on its own.
Or the PV might goes in and out of alarm.
Either case really indicates a problem in the alarm trigger PV. Still, the alarm
system latches the alarm at the original occurrence and annunciates only once
to reduce 'chatter'.
If the alarm re-occurs while the original alarm is still not acknowledged,
it is not annunciated again because we assume that operators are still
investigating the initial alarm, or just too busy to look at any alarms
right now. In either case, another annunciation would only cause noise.
The alarm system can also be configured with delays to only alarm if the
trigger PV persists for a certain time, which
can be used as a workaround for less than perfect alarm trigger PVs.
</p>
<p>
When a MINOR alarm is followed by a MAJOR alarm, or generally a higher level
alarm, that causes another annunciation because it is considered a different,
more important situation.
On the other hand, if an INVALID alarm relaxes to MAJOR or generally a lower
severity, the display will update to reflect the 'current' severity but
the alarm severity remains latched to the highest alarm level.
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging an alarm means to acknowledge the current alarm severity.
</p>
<p>
Acknowledge Example 1: A trigger PV goes MAJOR, alarm system goes into MAJOR alarm.
When acknowledged, the alarm is MAJOR-acknowledged.
Should the PV relax to MINOR, the current state of the alarm will be MINOR, but
the overall alarm state stays at MAJOR-acknowledged. If the PV actually cycles
between MINOR and MAJOR, there will be no new annuncuations because the operator
already acknowledged the MAJOR alarm.
Finally, once the PV clears to OK, all will be OK.
</p>
<p>
Acknowledge Example 2: A trigger PV goes MAJOR, alarm system goes into MAJOR alarm.
Operator looks at the problem, improves the situation but can't fully fix it, yet, so
the PV stays in MINOR alarm.
The alarm system will show that there was a MAJOR alarm, and right now the PV
is still in MINOR alarm.
When acknowledged, the alarm system state changes to MINOR-acknowledged.
If the PV clears to OK, all will be OK.
On the other hand, should the PV go back into MAJOR alarm, this would cause
a new annunciation because we only acknowledged when the PV was at a MINOR severity level.
</p>
<p>
Acknowledged alarms are less visible in the alarm system user interface
so that new, not-yet-acknowledged alarms are more obvious.
Operators can manually un-acknowledged alarms, which might be useful to
make them more visible again when trying to decide how to handle several
alarms.
</p>
<p>
In summary, acknowledging an alarm means to acknowledge the current severity
of the PV, and an alarm will fully 'clear', i.e. disappear from the alarm table when
the alarm trigger PV returns to OK <u>and</u> the alarm is acknowledged.
</p>



<h3>Non-Latching Alarms</h3>
<p>
The second diagram shows the behavior of alarms that are <u>not</u> configured
to latch. You will notice that it is very similar to the latched alarm
behavior except that non-latching alarms do not require acknowledgement.
They may be acknowledged to remove them from the list of 'active' alarms,
but they clear automatically once the trigger PV relaxes to "OK"
without requiring a manual alarm acknowledgement.
</p>
<p>
Typical use cases for non-latching alarms:
<ul>
<li>Something else in the control system already latches the alarm trigger PV.
    For example, the alarm trigger PV could be an "overtemperature" indicator
    of a power supply where the power supply already latches this indicator
    until it is reset at the power supply.
</li>
<li>A trigger PV is known to cause frequent brief alarms, and it would be
    too much work for operators to acknowledge each occurrence.
    In this case, configuring the alarm not to latch is a workaround, but
    in an ideal world you would fix the root cause:
    Remove noise from the alarm trigger PV, or configure the alarm system
    with a delay.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Annunciation</h3>
<p>
For alarms configured to annunciate, whenever a new alarm or a higher severity
alarm triggers, the severity and description of the alarm will be
<a href="#annunciation">annunciated</a>.
</p>


<h3>'Maintenance' Mode</h3>
<p>
During machine maintenance, devices are turned off on purpose, but related
alarms were not disabled, resulting in numerous nuisance alarms.
</p>
<p>
It is impossible for the computer to decide if an alarm should be disabled
automatically. IOC engineers can add logic to automatically suppress alarms,
but this is a rather complex and time consuming task.
</p>
<p>
Alarms can be disabled manually in the 
<a href="#pv_config">Alarm PV Configuration</a>.
Reports of disabled alarms can help to review which
alarms were disabled at what time, to avoid leaving
alarms disabled by accident.
But this process is again tedious.
</p>
<p>
While nuisance alarms during maintenance periods are hard to avoid,
one common source of alarms are INVALID alarms caused by IOCs,
PLCs or network equipment being turned off.
The 'Maintenance' Mode of the alarm server can help handle the
flurry of INVALID alarms as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>INVALID alarms are not annunciated
    (except <a href="#priority">'priority' annunciations</a>).
<li>INVALID alarms are automatically acknowledged (same 'priority' exception).
<li>When trigger PVs leave the INVALID state, for example go into MINOR,
    that is considered a new alarm.
</ol>

<p>
The (acknowledged) INVALID alarms are still displayed, but the missing annunciation 
reduces chatter in the control room.<br>
The automatic acknowledgement moves them off the list of active alarms,
reducing visual clutter.<br>
The third point asserts that possibly valid alarms after a device
is again accessible are not forgotten:
In 'normal' mode, a transition from INVALID(-acknowledged) to MAJOR alarm
would not cause an annunciation because there was already a more severe alarm level,
INVALID, and the device situation actually improved from INVALID to MAJOR.<br>
In 'maintenance' mode, the INVALID was automatically acknowledged,
and a MAJOR alarm is now considered a new situation that the operator
should review and manually acknowledge.
</p>
<p>
Maintenance mode is enabled or disabled via this icon in the
alarm tree and table GUI, which also indicates the current mode:
</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=icons/operate.gif> Normal Operating Mode, press to enable Maintenance Mode
<li><img src=icons/maintenance_act.gif> Maintenance Mode, press to return to normal operating mode
</ul>

<h2><a name=architecture>Architecture</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<img class="float" alt="Alarm System" src="AlarmSystem.png" />  
<p>
Technically, the alarm system consists of several elements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>IOCs:<br>
    Control System IOCs provide the Alarm Trigger PVs which indicate
    alarm conditions.
    In principle, one can display those PVs on generic operator screens,
    where they would for example show up as yellow or red.
    <br>
    Benefits of the alarm system over a basic operator screen:
    <ul>
    <li>Alarm can be annunciated.</li>
    <li>Alarm can latch to indicate the time of the original alarm.</li>
    <li>Additional guidance and links to related displays are accessible
        right from the alarm.</li>
    <li>When multiple alarms coincide, they can be sorted by for example
        severity or time.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>    
<li>Alarm Server:<br>
    The Alarm Server receives alarms from IOCs via Channel Access and sends
    alarm messages to a JMS Server.
    It also receives the acknowledgements from Alarm System GUIs.
    Most of the alarm logic is performed by the alarm server.
    </li>
<li>Alarm System GUI:<br>
    The Alarm System GUI, basically a table and tree view of current alarms
    in CSS, allows users to view current alarms, acknowledge them,
    invoke operator displays related to the alarm, browse the alarm history,
    or change the alarm configuration.
    </li>
<li>Annunciator, JMS2Speech:<br>
    The Annunciator included in the CSS alarm GUI or an alternate stand-alone
    JMS2Speech tool annunciate new alarms.
    Whenever a PV's severity changed to a <font color="#ff0000">higher severity</font>,
    the PV's description will be annunciated <font color="#ff0000">once</font>.
    </li>
<li>JMS Server:<br>
    The JMS Server is the message bus that allows the Alarm Server, GUI, JMS2Speech
    to communicate.
    </li>
<li>JMS2RDB:<br>
    This tool can write all JMS traffic to a Relational Database (RDB), allowing
    analysis of the most frequent alarms, reconstruction of the time line of
    a specific alarm, and more.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<p>
This manual focuses on how to use Alarm System GUI, not on the setup of
the alarm server.
</p>

<div class="clear"/>


<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=perspective>Alarm Perspective</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<img class="float" src=AlarmPerspective.png alt="Alarm Perspective">
<p>
Especially for first-time users it might be advisable to switch to the designated Alarm
Perspective, which results in a predefined arrangement of the Alarm Tree and
Alarm Table.

<h3>Activate or Reset</h3>
After opening an Alarm Table or Tree from the <code>CSS/Alarm</code> menu,
access the Alarm Perspective by right-clicking in the Alarm Table or Tree
and selecting <code>Alarm Perspective</code>. This action will switch to the
Alarm Perspective, or - if it was already active - allow you to reset it to
its original state, in case windows have been rearranged.
</p>


<h3>Rearranging the Perspective</h3>
<p>
You can simply close, minimize or maximize an Alarm Table or Alarm Tree window via
the usual icon in the window title bar or the context menu of the window title
bar. You can also adjust the size of each window.
</p>

<div class="clear"/>


<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=tree>Alarm Tree</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<img class="float" src="AlarmTree.png" alt="Alarm Tree" width="598" height="793"/>
<p>
The Alarm Tree provides an approach to browse the alarm configuration components
and their related alarm status in a tree-like structure, which by default includes
all configured alarms, active or not.
You can open it via the menu <code>CSS/Alarm/Alarm Tree</code>.
</p>
<p>
The Alarm Tree is synchronized with the configuration in the RDB.
When you change the configuration from within the Alarm Tree user interface,
the configuration in RDB will be updated, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
The Alarm Tree configuration is hierarchically arranged by 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Area: Front end, DTL, CCL, SCL, Ring, ... </li>
<li>System: ICS, Cooling, Vacuum, RF, ... </li>
<li>Optionally sub-system: ICS/IOCs, RF/LLRF, RF/HPRF, ... </li>
<li>Alarm Trigger PVs on the final level.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Alarm State Display</h3>
<p>
In addition to displaying the alarm configuration hierarchy, the alarm tree
also shows the current state of each item in several ways.
</p>
<p>
The image shows an example where a MINOR/HIGH alarm occured and has in fact
already been acknowledged ("minor-ack'ed/HIGH_ALARM"), but the trigger PV 
still exhibits the same MINOR/HIGH_ALARM, so the underlying issue has obviously
not been fixed to fully clear the alarm. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, a MAJOR/LINK_ALARM occurred, has not been acknowledged, and is still
active. A MAJOR/LOLO_ALARM occurred, but the alarm trigger PV has already cleared.
</p>

<h4>Alarm State Annotation</h4>
<p>
For each item in alarm, an annotation shows the severity and status of the
alarm state, i.e. the most severe alarm that has happened and not fully cleared.
For area, system and sub-system items this represents the state of the hierarchical
sub-entries with the highest alarm severity.
<pre>(Alarm Severity/Alarm Status)</pre>
</p>
<p>
For alarm trigger PVs, this includes the current state of the PV:
<pre>(Alarm Severity/Alarm Status, Current PV Severity/Current Status)</pre>
</p>

<h4>Alarm State Indicator, Colors</h4>
<p>
Besides the annotation there is also an alarm state indicator to the left of each item,
a color-coded representation of the severities.
The color of the left half of the indicator indicates the alarm severity,
while the right half indicates the current severity.
</p>
<p>
Acknowledged alarm severities are slightly darker than un-acknowledged severities.
</p>

<h4>Tool Tips</h4>
<p>
Finally, a tool-tip that appears when resting the mouse pointer over an alarm
gives a multiple-line textual description of the alarm.
</p>


<h3>Alarm Tree Toolbar</h3>
<p>
The toolbar on top of Alarm Tree provides basic functions for the tree and selected items.
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Send debug trigger to alarm server", <img src= icons/debug.gif>:<br>
    Trigger debug on alarm server
</li>
<li>"Configure Item", <img src= icons/configure.gif>:<br>
    For a PV item, you have several properties to configure:
    <a href="#pv_config">Alarm PV Configuration<a>.
    For the non-PV component, you can configure its guidance, displays and commands.
    Tree elements also "inherit" guidance, display and command information
    from its parent entries.
</li>
<li>"Acknowledge/Un-Acknowledge", <img src= icons/acknowledge.gif>/<img src = icons/unacknowledge.gif>:<br>
    You can acknowledge/un-acknowledge one or multiple item(s) you selected in the tree
    (Press "Ctrl" or "Shift" to select multiple items).
    For the non-PV component, all of its child items will be acknowledged/un-acknowledged.
</li>
<li>"Collapse alarm hierarchy", <img src= icons/collapse.gif>:<br>
    Make the alarm hierarchy appear in a collapsed state.
</li>
<li>"Show only alarms or whole configuration?", <img src= icons/only_alarms.gif>:<br>
    Show only alarms in the tree or the whole configuration.
    The tree will switch between the two modes when you click this button.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Context Menu Options</h3>
<p>
The common context menu options for all types of component in the tree are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=icons/clock.png> Time since event:<br>
    The elapsed time since the alarm happened.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/info.gif> Guidance messages:<br>
    If there are guidance messages configured for the item, it will be displayed here one by one.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/related_display.gif> Related displays:<br>
    If there are related displays configured for the item, it will be displayed
    here one by one. When you click one of them, the related display will be launched.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/command.gif> Commands:<br>
    If there are related commands configured for the item, it will be displayed
    here one by one. When you click one of them, the related command will be executed.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/acknowledge.gif>/<img src=icons/unacknowledge.gif> Acknowledge/Un-Acknowledge:<br>
    This option will be displayed only when the item is not in an "OK/OK/OK" state.
    If this is an un-acknowledged item, the option would be "Acknowledge" so
    that you can acknowledge it, and vice versa.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/configure.gif> Configure Item:<br>
    For a PV item, you have several properties to configure:
    <a href="#pv_config">Alarm PV Configuration<a>.
    For the non-PV component, you can configure its guidance, displays and commands.
    Tree elements also "inherits" guidance, display and commands from its parent entries.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/rename.gif> Rename Item:<br>
    Rename the selected item.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/move.gif> Duplicate PV:<br>
    Create a new PV which has the same settings
    as the selected PV.
    This is a convenient way to create similar alarm
    PVs by configuring the first PV,
    then duplicating it.
    You can of course later configure the newly
    created duplicate.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/move.gif> Move Item:<br>
    Move the selected items to another path in the tree.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/delete.gif> Remove Selected Items:<br>
    Delete the selected items from the tree and hence from the configuration.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For non-PV items, an additional menu option is available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=icons/add.gif> Add Component:<br>
    Add a new component to the configuration. You can add a child component
    under the item you selected, or add a new area regardless the selected item.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For PV items, two additional menu options are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=icons/elog.gif> LogBook...: <br>Open a logbook entry dialog editor
   for you to create an electronic logbook entry in logbook.
   This option will be available only when the item is actually in alarm,
   not when it is in an "OK" state.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/editcopy.png> Copy Pv Name to Clipboard
</li>
<li><code>CSS</code>: From this menu, you can access general CSS functions for the selected PVs.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>'Drag' Support</h3>
<p>
Selected alarms can be 'dragged' out of the alarm tree into another
program that accepts string drops.
For example, one can drag alarms into most email tools or
the web interface to an elog system. The dragged text will include
the alarm PV, description, and its current state.
</p>




<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=table>Alarm Table</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<p>
The Alarm Table provides a tabular view of currently active alarms.
It only shows alarms that actually triggered.
You can open it via the menu: <code>CSS/Alarm/Alarm Table</code>
</p>
<img class="float" src="AlarmTable.png" alt="Alarm Table" width="731" height="695"></img>

<h3>Alarm Properties</h3>
<p>
Each active alarm has several properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>PV</b>: name of the PV that triggered the alarm.</li> 
<li><b>Description</b>: the details of the PV. It would give more information and more human-readable than the raw PV name. It is also used for annunciation.</li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time when the alarm happened.</li> 
<li><b>Current Severity</b>: The current severity of the PV, like OK, MINOR, MAJOR or Invalid.</li>
<li><b>Severity</b>: The severity of the PV remembered by alarm server. When the PV is configured to "latch", the alarm server remembers the highest alarm severity of the PV until it is manually acknowledged. Current severity of the PV might differ from alarm severity when the underlying alarm PV already recovered but the alarm server was configured to "latch" the alarm until operator acknowledgement.</li>
<li><b>Status</b>: alarm status message like HIGH_ALARM or STATE_ALARM.</li> 
<li><b>Value</b>: Value of the PV that triggered this alarm.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The CSS Alarm Table allows sorting by any of the above properties by clicking
the corresponded property name on the column header.
</p>

<a name=#current_alarm>
<h3>Current Alarms and Acknowledged Alarms</h3>
</a>
<p>
The Alarm Table is split into two parts for displaying current alarms
(unacknowledged alarms) and acknowledged alarms respectively. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>For PV configured to "latch", even if its current severity has changed to "OK", the alarm will still be displayed as "Current Alarm" until it is manually acknowledged. </li>
<li>For PV not configured to "latch", it will disappear from the table of "Current Alarms" once its current severity changed to "OK".</li>
<li>For acknowledged alarm, regardless the PV is configured to "latch" or "not latch", if current severity of the PV is still not "OK", it will be displayed in the table of "Acknowledged Alarms" until its current severity changes to "OK".</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the details about how alarm severity jumps between different states,
please refer to the <a href="#AlarmState">Alarm Severity States Diagram</a>
</p>


<h3>Alarm Table Toolbar</h3>
<p>
The toolbar on top of Alarm Table provides the functions of
"Acknowledge" <img src= icons/acknowledge.gif> and
"Un-Acknowledge" <img src= icons/unacknowledge.gif>
for the selected items in the table.
</p>

<h3>Select PVs based on name or description</h3>
<p>
You can enter a PV name or part of an alarm description to select
all matching PVs in the alarm table.
</p>
<p>
The filter expression can contain these wild-cards:
</p>
<ul>
<li>'?' matches any single character
<li>'*' matches zero or more arbitrary characters
</ul>
<p>
The filter expression is not case-sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Example Filter Expressions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>'vac': Selects PVs where name or description contain 'vac', 'vacuum', ...
<li>'amp*trip': Would for example select PVs whose description contains 'Amplifier Trip'
</ul>

<h3>Context Menu Options</h3>
<p>
Most of the context menu options are also applicable for multiple items.
In this case, the "Guidance messages", "Related display" and "Command" for
the selected items will be merged.
You can select multiple items by holding Ctrl or Shift key.
</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=icons/clock.png> Time since event:<br>The elapsed time since the alarm happened.</li>
<li><img src=icons/info.gif> Guidance messages:<br> If there are guidance messages configured for the selected items, it will be displayed here one by one.</li>
<li><img src=icons/related_display.gif> Related displays:<br>If there are related displays configured for the selected items, it will be displayed here one by one. When you click one of them, the related display will be launched.</li>
<li><img src=icons/command.gif> Commands:<br> If there are related commands configured for the selected items, it will be displayed here one by one. When you click one of them, the related command will be executed.</li>
<li><img src=icons/elog.gif> LogBook...: <br>Open a logbook entry dialog editor for you to create an electronic logbook entry for the selected items in logbook.</li>
<li><img src=icons/acknowledge.gif>/<img src=icons/unacknowledge.gif> Acknowledge/Un-Acknowledge:<br> For items in the table of "Current Alarms", this should be "Acknowledge", so you can acknowledge the selected alarms. For itmes in "Acknowledged Alarms" table, this should be "Un-Acknowledge".</li>
<li><img src=icons/configure.gif> Configure Item:<br> You can configure properties of the selected PVs:
     <a href="#pv_config">Alarm PV Configuration<a>.
</li>
<li><img src=icons/editcopy.png> Copy Pv Name to Clipboard</li>
<li><code>CSS</code>: From this menu, you can access general CSS functions for the selected PVs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>'Drag' Support</h3>
<p>
Selected alarms can be 'dragged' out of the alarm table into another
program that accepts string drops.
For example, one can drag alarms into most email tools or
the web interface to an elog system. The dragged text will include
the alarm PV, description, and its current state.
</p>


<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=panel>Alarm Area Panel</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<p>
The Alarm Area Panel is a top-level display of the current alarm state.
A preference setting of the panel is used to configure which
level of the alarm tree hierarchy it should display.
</>

<img class="float" src="AlarmPanel.png" alt="Alarm Panel" width="317" height="560"></img>

<p>
It will typically be used to display the first level of the alarm
hierarchy, that is all Area components of the alarm tree.
For each area, it displays the name, coloring the panel to indicate the
alarm state of that area.
</p>
<p>
The tool can also be used to display a single panel with the
alarm state of the overall alarm tree, i.e. the root element,
by configuring it to use level 0 of the alarm tree hierarchy.
When set to level 2 of the alarm tree, it will display all System
components. With level 3 it would display all Sub-System components,
but this and higher alarm tree components are not useful in practice.
</p>

<p>
The context menu of a panel item allows access to the alarm tree,
opening the alarm tree view and focusing on the respecive alarm tree element.
The context menu also allows acknowledge/un-acknowledge of the alarm tree item
and all the alarm tree elements below it.
</p>

<p>
The tool has the following preference settings:
<ul>
<li>Alarm Tree Level:
Determines from which level of the alarm tree the items are displayed.
0 for root, 1 for area, 2 for system, 3 and higher would be sub-systems but
that is less practical. 
</li>
<li>Panel Columns: Determines in how many columns the items will be arranged for display.
</li>
</ul>
</p>



<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=preferences>Preference Settings</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<img class="float" src=AlarmPreferences.png alt="Alarm Preferences Configuration">
<p>
The Alarm System has numerous preferences which can be set for the GUI
client via the menu <code>CSS/Preferences...</code>, then navigating
to <code>CSS Applications/Alarm/Alarm System</code>:
</p>
<p>
For proper operation of the alarm system these settings must match
corresponding settings of the alarm server.
They should probably <u>not</u> be configured by end users via the preference panel
but instead set by the system administrator via appropriate
"Default Settings", see below.
</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Configuration Name<br>
The overall configuration name is used to select the alarm tree root component.

<li>JMS Alarm Server, Client, Talk Topics<br>
These are used to communicate with the alarm server and have to match
the alarm server configuration.

<li>RDB Server<br>
RDB that holds alarm PVs configuration and snapshot of state.

<li>JMS Server<br>
JMS Server for alarm messages service, such as new alarms, acknowledge, ...

<li>JMS Idle Timeout<br>
Timeout in seconds at which server sends idle messages in absence of
"real" traffic on alarm topic

<li>Command Directory<br>
Directory used for executing commands.
May use Java system properties like this: $(prop_name)

<li>Colors for alarm severities<br>
Configures the colors used in the alarm table and tree to represent alarms.
</ul>

<h3>Default Settings</h3>
While each user may specify custom settings, administrators should provide
default settings suitable for the respective site.

These original settings reside in the "preferences.ini" file inside the
org.csstudio.alarm plugin directory.
These settings are usually adapted to a specific site in a 
"plugin_customization.ini" file which is located in the root of the "Product"
plugin directory or jar file.
Further customization is possible when starting CSS (or any Eclipse product)
via a customization file with the same format provided via the
<code>-pluginCustomization</code> command line option.
Finally, each end user can use the CSS/Preferences menu item to
interactively adjust most settings. Those changes are stored in the
workspace directory under 
{Workspace}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings

<div class="clear"/>

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=edit>Editing the Alarm Configuration</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<p>
To edit the overall alarm configuration, that is to add components to the
hierarchical alarm tree, including Alarm Trigger PVs, or to rearrange
the alarm tree layout, use the context menu of the <a href="#tree">Alarm Tree</a>.
</p>

<img class="float" src="pv_config2.png" width="639" height="722"/>

<p>
The context menu entry "Configure item" opens a dialog box similar to the one
shown on the right.
The following explains configuration elements common to all alarm tree items.
The next section will elaborate on specifics of Alarm Trigger PVs.
</p>

<h3>Item</h3>
<p>
The item name displayed at the top of the dialog is the hierarchical path to item.
The item name is set when adding the item to the alarm configuration.
It cannot be modified within this dialog, but there are
are options in the context menu of the alarm tree to rename
an item or to move it to another location in the alarm tree.
</p>


<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>
A list of guidance messages for this item. Note
that items also "inherit" all guidance messages
of the higher-level components (System, Subsystem, ...) under which
they are listed, i.e. their "parent" components from
the alarm configuration hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Each guidance is separated into two parts:
<ul>
<li>Title: The title to be displayed as a context menu item and in the
    title of the guidance information dialog. 
    The max length of title is 30 characters.
<li>Details: Details of the guidance to be displayed in the guidance
    information dialog. May span multiple lines.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Tip:</b> If the guidance is very short and fits into the title, it
is sufficient to only enter the title. Whenever you only configure the title and leave
the details empty, or only configure the details and leave the title empty,
this implies that the respective other part is the same as the part you configured.
</p>


<h3>Related Displays</h3>
<p>
A list of related displays. Supported formats:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Operator Interface Display Files<br>
    If your CSS setup contains support for an operator interface panel tool,
    its screens can be opened by simply providing the screen file name within the workspace.
    <br>
    <code>/CSS/Share/DisplayFiles/Section/TheFile.opi</code><br>
    If the path name contains spaces, it has to be enclosed in quotes:<br>
    <code>"/CSS/Share/My Display Files/TheFile.opi"</code><br>
    <br>
    Additional parameters can be provided after the file name.
    For BOY *.opi screens this is a list of macros and their values,
    separated by comma, enclosed in quotes:<br> 
    <code>/CSS/Share/DisplayFiles/Section/TheFile.opi  "macro1=Value 1, macro2=Another Value"</code><br>
    <br>
    To use a web link as the display file name, it has to be prefixed by "opi:"
    to prevent it from being opened in a web browser:<br>
    <code>opi:http://my_display_file_server/get_display.cgi?name=TheFile.opi</code><br>
<li>Web Pages<br>
    Related displays starting in "http:" or "https:"
    are recognized as web page links. A web browser will be
    launched when the user selects this related display:<br>
    <code>http://some.web.server/page/foo.html</code>
<li>Workspace Files<br>
    Arbitrary workspace files, for example a Data Browser configuration file,
    can be opened via a URL starting in "file:":<br>
    <code>file:/Path/to/the_file.extension</code>
<li>External Programs<br>
    To start external display tools like EDM or MEDM, enter a command-line like<br>
    <code>startedm -m macro=value some_screen</code><br>
    Related displays are executed as described under "Commands",
    see below, so this requires a script like "startedm" to be available
    on your computer that can launch EDM with the appropriate settings.
    Note that the command to be executed must be on the path
    or in the "Command Directory". It is not possible to provide
    a full path to the external display command because a path starting with "/"
    would be treated as a display file name, not an external command.
    <br>
    The main reason for listing EDM etc. as related displays and
    not commands is the different way they appear to the end user.
    <br>
</ol>
<p>
As with guidance, each display item is separated into "Title"
and the "Command" which in this case is the actual related display link.
</p>


<h3>Commands</h3>
<p>
A list of commands that the user might want to invoke.
Enter a suitable command-line for executing the command,
for example
</p>
<p>
<code>/usr/local/bin/do_something MyPVName "another parameter"</code>
</p>
<p>
The command itself must either be on the operating system
path ($PATH in Unix) as it was set when CSS was started,
or the command name is listed
with its full path as shown in the example above.
</p>
<p>
Quotes (") can be used to include spaces inside an argument.
</p>
<p>
The command will be executed with the "current directory"
set to the "Command Directory" that is configured
in the alarm system preferences <pre>org.csstudio.alarm.beast/command_directory</pre>.
Note that the commands are executed by the operating system that runs the notfier.
Commands in the <pre>command_directory</pre> may not be executed unless
the PATH variable of the operating system includes the current directory ".",
the command itself is specified as "./the_command" to select the current directory as set via the <pre>command_directory</pre>,
or the PATH lists the full path to the <pre>command_directory</pre>.
</p>


<p>
A suggested setup would probably place all alarm system related
commands in a directory like <code>/usr/local/css/alarm_scripts</code>,
include that in the operating system path and also set the
"Command Directory" to it.
</p>
<p>
If the command fails to execute, this will be displayed in a dialog box.
Otherwise the program is allowed to run unattended,
i.e. the alarm GUI does not wait for the command to finish.
</p>

<p>
As with guidance and related displays, each command item is separated
into "Title" and the "Command" which in this case is the actual
command to invoke.
</p>


<h3>Automated Notifications</h3>
<p>
If alarms persist for a certain time without being acknowledged or cleared,
and automated notification can be generated.
</p>
<p>
If you configure a notification for an alarm trigger PV, the default message will
contain the alarm info for that PV.
If you configure a notification for a system or area, the default message will list
the PVs in alarm below that section of the alarm tree.
</p>
<p>
The configuration of an automated notification has three parts:
<ol>
<li>Title: The title to be displayed as a context menu item. The max length of title is 30 characters.
</li>
<li>Delay: Delay in seconds before the notification is performed.
    If the alarm is acknowledged or clears before this delay, no notification will be performed.</li>
<li>Details: Details of the automated action to be executed.
    The exact format of the notification detail depends on the type of notification,
    for example email, as listed below.
</li>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The automated notifications are performed by a designated "alarm-notifier"
that must be running in parallel to the alarm server.
</p>


<h4>Email Notifications</h4>
<p>
Email notifications start with "mailto:", using the RFC 6068 URL schema.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
mailto:user@my.org
mailto:list1@example.com,list2@example.fr
mailto:list1@example.com;list2@example.fr;list3@example.fr
mailto:user1@my.org?cc=support@my.org&bcc=john.doe@gmail.com
mailto:user@my.org?cc=rf@my.org&subject=*RF Source 1 in error&body={0} Alarm raised - Water below {1} m3
</pre>

<p>
Within the configuration, the text <code>{0}</code> will be replaced with the alarm severity
and <code>{1}</code> with the value that triggered the alarm.
</p>

<h4>SMS Notifications</h4>
<p>
SMS notifications start with "sms:", using the RFC 3966 URL schema. 
It will send an email at the following adresse: [sms:<i>phone_number</i>(,<i>phone_number</i>)*].
This formatting need to be handled by the email gateway.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
sms: +33 4 42 17 64 21, +33 6 03 74 36 61; +33 4 42 17 61 08
sms: +33 6 03 74 36 61?body={0} Alarm raised - Water below {1} m3
</pre>

<p>
Within the configuration, the text <code>{0}</code> will be replaced with the alarm severity
and <code>{1}</code> with the value that triggered the alarm.
</p>

<h4>External Command</h4>
<p>
The prefix "cmd:" selects an external command to be executed. Examples:
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>cmd:caput SomePV 1
cmd:my_notifier *
</pre>

<p>
Within the configuration, the text <code>*</code> will be replaced with a list
of alarm PVs and alarm severities.
</p>

<p>
The command is executed with the working directory defined by the preference
<pre>org.csstudio.alarm.beast/command_directory</pre> of the notifier.
</p>


<!-- Not implemented:
SMS: sms URL scheme (RFC 5724). Example: "sms:+15105550101,+15105550102"
Phone: tel URL scheme (RFC 2806). Example: "tel:+15105550101,+15105550102"s
 -->

<h4>Sequence of commands</h4>
<p>
Several commands can be executed one after an other in the same automated notification 
using quotes and ';' as separators.
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
"mailto:list1@example.com,list2@example.fr";"cmd:caput SomePV 1"
</pre>


<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=pv_config>Alarm Trigger PV Configuration</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<p>
For alarm trigger PVs, the configuration explained in the previous section contains
additional elements that are specific to PVs.
</p>

<h3>Item</h3>
<p>
The last section of the item name displayed at the top of the dialog
must be a PV name understood by the control system.
The PV name is set when adding the PV to the alarm configuration.
The PV name cannot be modified within this dialog, but there are
are options in the context menu of the alarm tree to rename
the PV or to move it to another location in the alarm tree.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The PV's description should be more human-readable than
the raw PV name. It is displayed with the alarm
and also used for annunciation.
</p>
<p>
Check the <a href="#annunciation">annunciation</a> description
further below for details on how the description is used
for the annunciation of alarms.
</p>

<h3>Enabling Alarms</h3>
<p>
Per default all alarms are enabled. By de-selecting the "enabled"
check-box the alarm server can be configured to ignore alarms
from this PV.
</p>
<p>
<em>
This is meant as a temporary fix, for example to handle a broken
sensor that causes erroneous alarms.
Disabled alarms should be reviewed periodically and then either
removed from the alarm configuration or fixed so that they
can be re-enabled. 
</em>
</p>

 
<h3>Latching Alarm Behavior</h3>
<p>
The latching behavior defines how the alarm server handles
a PV that goes into an alarm state, and then recovers.
When configured to "latch", the alarm server remembers the
highest alarm severity of the PV until it is manually
acknowledged.
</p>


<h3>Alarm Annunciation</h3>
<p>
When a PV is configured to "annunciate", the alarm server
will send the PV's description to the
<a href="#annunciation">annunciation system</a>
whenever the PV reaches a non-OK severity. 
</p>


<h3>Alarm Delay and Count Filter</h3>
<p>
Per default, the alarm server will react as soon as it
notices a non-OK alarm severity.
When adding a delay greater than zero, specified in seconds,
it will only react when the alarm severity remains for at
least this time.
When an additional alarm count greater than zero is specified,
it will react to alarms that either outlast the delay,
or happen at least "count" times within the delay.
</p>
<p>    
Both these options can reduce the amount of "nuisance" alarms
from noisy PVs, but in practice it is always best to cure the
problem at the source through adequate dead-bands or smoothing.
</p>


<h3>Filter</h3>
<p>
A filter expression can be used to enable or disable alarms
automatically. When entering a filter expression, the previously
described "enable" field is ignored.
</p>
<p>
The filter expression can be something like
</p>
<p>
<code>some_other_pv > 5</code>
</p>
<p>
to only enable the alarm when the other PV has a value above 5.
</p>
<p>
This feature was added to ease the transition from other alarm handling
systems.
Ideally, state-based alarms are <em>handled on the front-end computer
by adding logic that prevents the alarm from being generated,</em>
instead of generating an alarm but then disabling it in the
alarm server.
</p>
<p>
Also note a shortcoming of the current implementation:
The Alarm Server only subscribes to PV value updates for alarm
changes, and this includes the PVs used to compute the filter
expression.
An alarm expression like <code>some_other_pv &gt; 5</code> will <u>not</u>
be evaluated for each change in the value of <code>some_other_pv</code>;
it <em>will only be evaluated for changes in the alarm state</em>
of <code>some_other_pv</code>, so the value changes used in the filter
expression must also be alarm state changes of <code>some_other_pv</code>!
</p>



<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<h2><a name=annunciation>Voice Annunciation</a></h2> 
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<p>
For alarms that are <a href="#pv_config">configured to be annunciated</a>,
the alarm server sends an annunciation request to the annunciator.
</p>
<p>
The annunciation is performed by is either the Annunciator view included
in the CSS alarm user interface, or the standalone Annunciator tool.
In the control room, at least one instance of these annunciation tools should
be running on a designated alarm OPI at all times.
</p>

<h3>Annunciator</h3>
<p>
The CSS Annunciator included in CSS is started via the menu
<code>CSS/Alarm/Annunciator</code> and has to remain visible to function.
</p>

<h3>Annunciator</h3>
<p>
The Annunciator is also available as standalone tool. While it has to be launched from the command-line,
separate from the CSS GUI, its advantage lies in the fact that it continues to
annunciate even when the CSS GUI is closed.
It will annunciate independently from alarm table or -tree displays.
</p>
<p>
It is usually launched by a shell command
<pre>
  annunciator
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Annunciation Text</h3>
<p>
By default, the alarm server will use the "Description" of
an alarm for annunciation, prefixed by the alarm severity.
</p>
<p>
For example, a MAJOR alarm on a PV with Description "Low Water Pressure"
will result in an annunciation
<pre>
  "MAJOR alarm: Low Water Pressure"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When prefixed with an asterisk character '*', the alarm server will
use the description as given.
It will <i>not</i> prefix it with the alarm severity.
</p>
<p>
A PV with Description "*Low Water Pressure" thus results in just announcing
<pre>
  "Low Water Pressure"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In addition, descriptions starting with '*' can include the following
formatting elements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The text "{0}" is replaced with the current alarm severity.</li>
<li>The text "{1}" is replaced with the value of the trigger PV that caused the alarm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, a PV with description "*{0} alarm: Low Water Pressure"
would again result in an annunciation
<pre>
  "MAJOR alarm: Low Water Pressure"
</pre>
The effect would be the same as having used the default annunciation
format without "*...".
</p>
<p>
By using the "*..." format, however, you can also use descriptions like
"*{0} water alarm, level is {1} gallons"
which will result in an annunciation similar to
<pre>
  "MAJOR water alarm, level is 3.142 gallons"
</pre>
</p>
<p>The format elements can be in any order. For example, the value can be used
before the alarm severity. The description "*Water below {1} gallons, {0} alarm"
will result in an annunciation similar to
<pre>
  "Water below 3.142 gallons, MAJOR alarm"
</pre>
</p>


<h3>Annunciation Order</h3>
<p>
Fundamentally, messages are annunciated in the order of arrival.
When several messages arrive at almost the same time, or more messages
arrive while the first message is annunciated,
those are ordered by severity, most severe first.
</p>

<h3>Annunciation Throttle</h3>
<p>
When many alarms occur at the same time, this could result in a long
stream of voice annunciation.
Operators, on the other hand, probably don't need to hear every single
alarm annunciated as much as they need to be alerted to the fact that
many alarms happened, so they can use their judgment to determine
which one is most important.
</p>
<p>
The annunciator therefore has a message count threshold (default 3):
Assuming that 10 more messages arrive after annunciating the first message,
exceeding the threshold of 3, the tool will annunciate
<pre>
  "There are ten more messages"
</pre>
instead of annunciating each individual message.
</p>

<a name='priority'>
<h3>Priority Annunciations, Circumventing the Annunciation Throttle</h3>
</a>
<p>
For alarms deemed too important to be suppressed by the annunciation
throttle, the Description can be prefixed with a "!":
<pre>
  !The sky is falling
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In case the alarm severity should not be included in the annunciation,
but the annunciation should always happen and not be filtered by the
annunciation throttle, use this format:
<pre>
  *!The sky is falling
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Either '*!' as shown with '*' first, then '!',
or '!*' are allowed.
The '*' tells the alarm server to suppress the alarm severity
because a custom format is used,
the '!' instructs the annunciator to exclude this message
from the message throttle.
</p>


<h3>Annunciator Settings</h3>
<p>
The Annunciator has its own preference settings.
In principle, this would allow use of one annunciator
for multiple alarm systems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>URL: JMS server URL. Usually has to match the URL used by the Alarm Server
    and client GUI, but allows use of the Annunciator in other setups, for example
    by pointing to the URL of a JMS mirror for multiple alarm server setups.
</li>
<li>Topics: Comma-separated list of JMS TOPICS. Typically those used by Alarm
    Servers.
</li>
<li>Translation File: The computer speech library is imperfect. Especially 
    abbreviations are better spelled out ("Mebbit" instead of "MEBT").
    A translations file can include such translations which are automatically
    applied to all received TEXT before it is annunciated.<br>
    Specify the full path to a file that contains this:
    <pre>
# File of translations
# Format:
#       some_regular_expression_pattern = translation

INVALID=in valid
MEBT=mebbit
    </pre>
    To avoid confusion, though, it's usually better to <u>not</u> use
    translations and instead change the annunication text in the Alarm Server
    configuration.
</li>
<li>Severities: Comma-separated list of recognized severities, highest priority first.
</li>
<li>Threshold: Number of queued messages beyond which messages are cleared.
</li>
<li>Message History: Number of past messages shown in the annunciator history.
</li>
</ul>

</body>
</html>
