## Default preferences for this plugin

# Threshold for ignoring flurry of automated actions. When more than this number
# of messages queue up, all low-priority actions are cancelled & others are forced to execute.
# This threshold represents a number of actions per minute per action type 
# (= per implementation of org.csstudio.alarm.beast.notifier.model.IAutomatedAction)
timer_threshold=100
