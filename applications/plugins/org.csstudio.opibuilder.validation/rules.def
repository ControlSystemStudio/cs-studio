# The file lists all properties of all widgets that should obey specific rules.
# If a certain property is listed in this file the validator will check if the 
# OPI file follows this rule with respect to the schema OPI. Each property
# can be either read only (RO), readable/writable (RW), or obligatory writable (WRITE).
# Read only properties should have the same values as defined by the OPI schema, 
# readable/writable properties can have any value, obligatory writable properties
# must have a value, which is not null or empty. 
# If the property is not listed here it is automatically assumed to be writable. If 
# there is a property that is related to a specific widget it has priority 
# over a general property.

#! Example
#! border_width will be read-only for all widgets, except for the polyline, for which it is writable
#! border_width=RO
#! polyline.border_width=RW
#! pv_name property is obligatory writable
#! pv_name=WRITE

border_color=RO
pv_name=WRITE
ActionButton.font=RO
border_width=RO
polyline.border_width=RW
