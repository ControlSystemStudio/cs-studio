# Annunciator class to use:
# FreeTTS, JSAPI - Similar
# External - Invokes an external command
# UDP - Sends each annunciation as UDP packet
annunciator=JSAPI

# FreeTTS/JSAPI voices
# "kevin" - default
# "kevin16" - sounds clearer on some systems, but 'stutters' on RedHat 6
# "alan" - Specialized, mostly for numbers, not generic text
voice=kevin

# External command used to perform the annunciation.
# Must take the text as an argument.
command=say

# Host and Port used in UDP mode
# Default uses global broadcast (discouraged)
# Suggestion is to use subnet broadcast like
# 128.1.2.255 or specific IP address of UDP server
#
# For testing, netcat can be useful:
#
#  nc -l -p 6543 -u
host=255.255.255.255
port=6543
