Wonder how to open a new Data Browser plot?
Cannot locate the 'Property' panel to configure the Data Browser?
Closed the 'Archive Search' panel and now you want it back?
<br/>
This gets you back to a default window setup:
</description>
</intro>

<item title="Open new Plot">
<description>
Select CSS->Trends->Data Browser in the menu bar at the top of the workbench.
</description>
</item>

<item title="Select Data Browser Perspective">
<description>
Right-click on plot, select &quot;Data Browser Perspective&quot;.
<br/>
If the Data Browser Perspective was already open, a dialog will
appear that allows you to "Reset" it. Press "Yes", you're done!
<br/>
If the Data Browser Perspective was <b>not</b> already open, it will now open.
Right-click on the plot and select &quot;Data Browser Perspective&quot; again,
and this time you can reset it.

You're done. There should be an 'Archive Search' panel to the left
and 'Properties', 'Export Samples' panels at the bottom.
