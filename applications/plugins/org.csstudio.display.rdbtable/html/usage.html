<h1>RDB Table Editor Usage</h1>
The following assumes that
<a href="config.html">configuration files</a>
have been prepared.

<h2>Open RDB Table Editor</h2>
The RDB Table Editor is launched by opening
an existing configuration file in the <i>Navigator</i>.
Either double-click on a file ending in ".rdb",
or right-click and select <code>Open With; RDB Table Editor</code>.

<h2>RDB Login</h2>
While some configuration files might contain a user and password
necessary to connect to the RDB, other configuration files might
not contain that information and instead require each user to log
on individually.
<p>
In the latter case, a dialog will appear that prompts for the
user and password:
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="login.png" alt="Login Dialog" width="599" height="258"/></div>

<h2>Editing</h2>
This is an example screenshot of the RDB Table editor:
<div align="center"><img src="rdbtable.png" alt="RDB Table" width="625" height="281"/></div>

Note that all editing is local until you "save" the changes, i.e. write them to the RDB.

<h3>Modifying Cells</h3>
In the table editor, modify selected cells by clicking the cell and entering
a new value.
Rows with modified cells will be highlighted in yellow, and a tool-tip will
also indicate that the row was changed
<p>
Note that the first, leftmost column contains a "key" that's used to
identify the row in the RDB.
In the screenshot it's the "ID" column.
You can only change that "key" for newly added rows (see below),
not for existing rows.

<h3>Adding Rows</h3>
Add new rows by opening the context menu (right-click in table)
and selecting <img src="add.gif" width="16" height="16"/>"Add".
The new row will look like the bottom row in the screenshot,
where you can now enter the individual cell values, including the
"key" which must usually be unique, i.e. different from other rows.

<h3>Deleting Rows</h3>
Select the rows, then mark them for deletion via the 
context menu (right-click in table)
and selecting <img src="delete.gif" width="16" height="16"/>"Delete".
Rows marked for deletion will have a grey background like the one with ID 386
in the screenshot, and a tool-tip will also indicate that the row was marked
for deletion.

<h3>Saving Changes to the RDB</h3>
To write new rows, cell modifications or row deletions to the RDB,
"save" the changes via the <img src="save.gif" width="16" height="16"/> File/Save menu.
When simply closing the editor window you will also be prompted to
save pending changes.
