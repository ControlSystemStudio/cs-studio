<h1>JMS Monitor</h1>

The JMS Monitor is a utility for monitoring raw JMS messages.
It is a debug tool for developers.

<p>

After entering a JMS "Topic" like "LOG", "ALARM", "TALK" etc.,
it will display received messages.
It is possible to enter a list of comma-separated topics.
<p>
The "Clear" button removes received messages from the table.


<h2>Message Detail</h2>

<p>
Message detail for a selected row is available via 
Properties View.
<p>
You can open the Properties view by double-clicking on a
message in the table.
<p>
The application is currently limited to "Map" and "Text" messages.

<h2>Preferences</h2>
The JMS server URL is configured via Eclipse preferences.
Initial defaults are in file preferences.ini of the JMS Monitor plugin;
the application's plugin_customization.ini can override,
and finally they can also be changed via the preference GUI:
<ul>
<li>JMS Server URL: Specifies the server URL, also displayed in the JMS
    monitor GUI.
    Since the URL may list more than one JMS server, the GUI also displays
    the srever to which the tool actually connected.
<li>JMS User, Password: User and password used to establish the connection
    to the JMS server. They can often be left blank.
<li>Max Message Count: If the JMS monitor continued to display every received
    message, this would consume a lot of memory.
    The tool therefore employs a ring buffer. By default, it only keeps the last
    500 messages, but you can adjust that number.
</ul>
