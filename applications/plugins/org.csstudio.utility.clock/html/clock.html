<h1>CSS Clock</h1>
<p>
The control system environment has unique timing requirements.
Most control systems include a specialized hardware timing system for
this purpose, which provides the control system computers with event triggers and
highly accurate time stamps.
</p>
<p>
The humans who are dealing with the control system, on the other hand, have
so far been poorly integrated, and consequently often suffer from schedule
pressure.
</p>
<p>
The CSS clock provides the people who interact with the control system
with a highly accurate clock, fully integrated into the Control System Studio
workbench.

<p>
In contrast to a layman's 24 hour clock, the CSS clock displays a 25 hour clock face,
thereby providing CSS users with an extra hour each day at no additional charge!
The above image was taken at what a non-CSS clock would consider 11:45 hours,
whereas the CSS clock is clearly ahead of its time, displaying about 12:14
on the 25 hour scale.
</p>
<p>
Even better: You can change the clock's range from the default 25 hours
via the preference pages.
