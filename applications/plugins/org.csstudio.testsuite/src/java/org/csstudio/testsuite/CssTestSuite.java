/**
 * Class that collects all tests (class files that end on *&lt;testFilter&gt;.class) in the specified
 * bundles, creates and starts a test suite.
 *
 * Different launch configurations already exist - all of them start a JUnit Plugin Test (also for
 * simple unit tests), since only then the test suite has access to the unit tests in all bundles
 * selected in the launch configuration.
 *
 * Any class in any bundle is tried to be loaded (which triggers the bundle activation) and analysed
 * whether it extends a {@link junit.framework.TestCase} for JUnit < 4.0 or whether any of its
 * methods features the {@link org.junit.Test} annotation for JUnit >= 4.0.
 * If so, it is added to the suite, otherwise it's not, and a warning is generated when the class'
 * name is suggesting it being a test without being one (often observed for demo applications that
 * are named XXXApplicationTest).
 *
 * Set -DtestFilter=UnitTest|HeadlessTest|UiPluginTest in the jvm arguments of the launch
 * configuration.
 *
 * Default is 'Test' meaning any test is executed (hence you are required to set the launch
 * configuration's start application to any product (best is the common product) in main tab.
