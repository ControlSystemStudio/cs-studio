<h1>Overview</h1>
The CSS EPICS PV Tree displays the hierarchical data flow between EPICS
records.
It displays the record types, their current values as well as
severity/status.
It attempts to follow the data flow by traversing input links
(INP, INPA, DOL, ...).

<h2>Usage</h2>
Enter a name into the "PV" text box, and see what happens.
Names can be entered in various ways:
<ul>
<li>Type a PV name (Autocomplete will help you), followed by "Return". </li>
<li>Select a previously entered PV name from the drop-down list
attached to the PV name text box. </li>
<li>Drop a PV name from another CSS application into the "Tree" area
below the PV name. </li>
<li>Send a PV name to the EPICS PV tree via the context menu of another
CSS application.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
The first screen-shot shows an analog input (ai) record, which reads its
input (INP) directly from a device support module that happens to understand
the input description "adm606m....". 
</p>

The second screen-shot shows a more interesting hierarchy:
A binary input record (bi) reads from a calculation (calc), whose first input
(INPA) reads from an mbbi which in turn reads from another calc and so on.
Note how the color-coding indicates severities.

<h2>Tool Bar Buttons</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/collapse.gif" />
- Collapse the tree, i.e. close all sub-sections of the tree.
</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../icons/alarmtree.png" />
- Display all items in the tree that are in an alarm state.
Note that this is performed whenever you push the tool bar button.
If the PV tree items update, branches will not automatically
show or hide based on their alarm state, because this could
result in a very nervous display for a rapidly changing
PV tree.
Whenever you desire to update the tree to show/hide items,
push the button.
</p>

- Expand all sub-sections of the tree.
</p>


<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
This tool uses the EPICS network protocol, Channel Access, to read PVs.
There is no way to query EPICS V3 IOCs for their database information
to determine the available "input" links.
</p>
<p>
The knowledge of which links to follow for each record type is therefore
configured into the EPICS PV Tree application. It is at this time not
configurable by end users, but people with access to the
source code can determine the syntax from the preferences.ini file
and override in the CSS plugin_customization.ini for site-specific
settings.
