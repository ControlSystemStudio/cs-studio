<!-- "Simulation" Configuration

  Defines the simulation characteristics of
  selected process variables.
  
  In the long run, the XML file can be auto-generated
  from an RDB, and tools could also directly read from the RDB.
  Still, for robustness' sake, there should probably always be
  a local XML "snapshot" instead of relying on an RDB connection
  to a server outside of the beamline subnet for basic scan system operation.

         is organized in the same devices/device/pv/name
         hierarchy as the beamline configuration file
         so that in principle one file could contain
         both the beamline and simulation information.
