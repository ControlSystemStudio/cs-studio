/** JUnit test of simple send/receive performance.
 *  <p>
 *  Receiver checks the sequence of received messages
 *  and will detect missing or double messages.
 *  <p>
 *  Because the start and stop aren't further coordinated,
 *  the receiver will miss some initial or final messages.
 *  <p>
 *  Test with laptop to srv02 and back: about 1000 msg/sec.
 *  Test with new imac to srv02 and back: about 4000 msg/sec.
