<h2>Save Set Editor</h2>
<p>
Save set editor is composed of two parts:
<ul>
<li><i>Description area</i> displays a simple description of the save set</li>
<li><i>PV List</i> displays the list of PVs and other information</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class='figure'><img src="saveseteditor.png"/><p>Fig. 1: Save Set Editor</p></div>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Save set description should be a human readable description explaining what this save set represents. In a well
organised system this can be achieved to some extent by placing the save set into the most appropriate branch
of the repository tree. However, additional information might be required in certain cases. There are no limitations to
the length of the description.
</p>
<h3>PV List</h3>
<p>
PV list is actually a comma separated spreadsheet. Each entry in the spreadsheet has 3 possible values:
<ul>
<li><i>PV</i> is the name of the setpoint PV that will be stored into snapshots and restored when requested</li>
<li><i>READBACK</i> is the name of the readback PV which will also be stored into snapshots but will not be restored</li>
<li><i>DELTA</i> is a threshold value for comparison of readback to setpoint (or any other comparison). If values differ
for less than this threshold (in any direction) they will be considered within limits, if they differ more, they will
be marked in the snapshot viewer.</li>
<li><i>READ_ONLY</i> defines whether the PV given in the first column is read only or not. Read-only PVs are included
when the snapshot is taken, but are never restored. The value in this column should be either <b>true</b> or
<b>false</b>. If no value is given, false is assumed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It is desirable that a save set provides values for all three spreadsheet columns, though it is not mandatory. The
only mandatory column is <i>PV</i>, the other two are optional. However, <i>DELTA</i> can only be defined if <i>READBACK</i>
is also defined. It is also mandatory that all entries follow the same pattern - all rows in the list have to have the
same number of columns. If certain value cannot be defined for a PV, the value of that column can be left empty. For example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
PV,READBACK,DELTA,READ_ONLY<br/>
PV1,PV1_GET,20,false<br/>
PV2,PV2_GET,20,true<br/>
PV3,,,<br/>
PV4,PV4_GET,,<br/>
PV5,,20,false
</code>
</p>
<h5>DELTA</h5>
<p>
Delta can be given as a constant value, which means that two values will always be compared as
<code>
|value1 - value2| &le; delta
</code>
(absolute value of the difference should be less or equal to delta). The delta can also be given in a form of a one or
two parameter function. If the function accepts one parameter (<code>x</code>), it must return a numerical value,
which will be used for comparison as described above. In this case the parameter will be the base value at which we
want to calculate the threshold. If the function accepts two parameters (<code>base</code> and <code>value</code>),
it must return a boolean value, which indicates if the two values are within limits (<code>true</code>)
or not (<code>false</code>). In this case the <code>value</code> is the value of the PV, which is being evaluated and
<code>base</code> is the value which the <code>value</code> parameter is being evaluated against. The function is evaluated
as a JavaScript function. The following operations and elementary functions are supported:
<ul>
<li><code>*</code>: multiplication (e.g. x*5)</li>
<li><code>/</code>: division (e.g. x/5)</li>
<li><code>+</code>: addition (e.g. x+5)</li>
<li><code>-</code>: subtraction (e.g. x-5)</li>
<li><code>Math.PI</code>: the value of &pi; (3.14159...)</li>
<li><code>Math.E</code>: Euler's number (2.71828...)</li>
<li><code>Math.sin(x)</code>: trigonometric sine of angle x</li>
<li><code>Math.cos(x)</code>: trigonometric cosine of angle x</li>
<li><code>Math.tan(x)</code>: trigonometric tangent of angle x</li>
<li><code>Math.asin(x)</code>: arc sine of x in radians</li>
<li><code>Math.acos(x)</code>: arc cosine of x in radians</li>
<li><code>Math.atan(x)</code>: arc tangent of x in radians</li>
<li><code>Math.abs(x)</code>: absolute value of x</li>
<li><code>Math.exp(x)</code>: Euler's number raised to the power of x</li>
<li><code>Math.log(x)</code>: natural logarithm (base E) of x</li>
<li><code>Math.sqrt(x)</code>: square root of x</li>
<li><code>Math.min(x,y)</code>: minimum of x and y</li>
<li><code>Math.max(x,y)</code>: maximum of x and y</li>
<li><code>Math.pow(x,y)</code>: x raised to the power of y</li>
</ul>
Functions may also be combined. For example:
<code>Math.min(x+5,20)+Math.sqrt(x)</code>
</p>
<p>
Below are some examples of valid functions. Let's assume that we are comparing stored value <code>Z</code> against the
live value <code>Y</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>x*2</code>: the values will be within limits when the following is satisfied <code>|Z-Y| &le; Y*2</code></li>
<li><code>Math.min(x,20)</code>: the values will be within limits when <code>|Z-Y| &le; Math.min(Y,20)</code></li>
<li><code>(base &#62;&#61; 10 &#38;&#38; value &#62; 15) || (base &#60; 10 &#38;&#38; value &#60; 5)</code>: the values will be
within limits when the function evaluates to <code>true</code>, meaning <code>(Y &ge; 10 and Z &#62; 15)
or (Y &#60; 10 and Z &#60; 5)</code></li>
<li><code>Math.abs(base - value) &le; 20</code>: the values will be within limits when <code>|Z-Y| &le; 20</code></li>
</ul>
An example of the save set file with functions:
<p>
<code>
PV,READBACK,DELTA,READ_ONLY<br/>
PV1,PV1_GET,x*2,true<br/>
PV2,PV2_GET,(base &#62;&#61; Math.PI &#38;&#38; value &#62; 15) || (base &#60; Math.PI &#38;&#38; value &#60; 5),<br/>
PV3,,,<br/>
PV4,PV4_GET,"Math.pow(x,3)",true<br/>
PV5,,20,
</code>
</p>
NOTE: If you used one of the functions that contains the comma character (<code>,</code>), such as <code>Math.pow(x,y)</code>,
make sure that you wrap the entire function into double quotes (<code>"</code>).

<h4>Editor</h4>
<p>
The PV list editor is very simple and does not offer any fancy spreadsheet editing functionality. However, you can use
certain common editing functions, such as cut, copy, paste, and select all. You may of course use your preferred
spreadsheet editor to generate the contents and then copy them as text into the editor and save it.
</p>
<p>
As you change the contents the editor will constantly perform data integrity checks. If it detects that the content is
malformed (e.g. a row is missing a column) it will paint a red border around the editor. At that time saving the save
set will be disabled.
</p>
<p>
When you are done with editing you have an option to save the contents as a new file or overwrite an existing file. You
may choose the appropriate action from the <i>File</i> menu. If you decide to save the set as a new file, a location
selector will be displayed. Use the tree in the selector to select the appropriate location (you may create new folders
by right clicking a parent item and selecting the <i>New Folder...</i> item). After you have selected the appropriate
location type in the name for the save set into the <i>Save Set Name</i> field. This is the name that is also
displayed in the browser.
