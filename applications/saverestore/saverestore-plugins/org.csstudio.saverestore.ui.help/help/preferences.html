<h1>Preferences</h1>
The following general preferences are available:
<ul>
<li><i>Number of snapshots loaded at once</i>: some data providers might provide the option to load only specific number
of snapshots (going from the most recent back). You can specify how many snapshots you want to fetch in a single batch.
In case you set the number to 0, all snapshots will be fetched. If the value is positive, the snapshot browser will
provide additional buttons to fetch the next batch of snapshots.</li>
<li><i>Open new snapshots in compare view</i>: specify if new snapshots are opened in the same editor in which they
were taken (in this case the new snapshot will be compared to the others already opened). If the checkbox is not ticked,
every snapshot that you take, will appear in a new editor.</li>
</ul>
Different data providers might provide additional settings, which are displayed in the sub tab.
