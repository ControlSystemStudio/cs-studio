	<h2>
		<a name="overview">Overview</a>
	</h2>
	<p>OPI Validation tool built on the Eclipse's validation framework
		provides means to validate and quickly fix existing OPI files with
		regards to the OPI schema. Validation can be invoked manually on an
		OPI file or group of OPI files by invoking the "Validate" context menu
		item. Manually invoking validation will run validation in the
		background. When validation completes, a validation results dialog is
		displayed, and any problems found will be shown in the Problems view.
		To open the Problems view, select Problems from the menu bar Window ->
		Show View -> Other... -> General -> Problems. Double-clicking on an
		error/warning/info message in this view opens the respective editor
		(OPI Editor or OPI Runtime) and highlights the failing widget.
		Finally, from the Problems view, fixes can be applied on one or many
		error/warning messages by invoking the "Quick fix" context menu item.
		A confirmation is asked for making a backup before applying the fix.
		After the quick fix is completed, the modified OPI files are
		revalidated.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="started">Getting Started</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The validation plugin requires two input files <i>OPI Schema</i> and <i>Validation
			Rules</i> definition file. First make sure that you have a schema file
		well defined and that the properties of individual widgets in the
		schema are exactly like you want them. Then you need to compose the
		validation rules; for each property of a widget there can be exactly
		one defining how that property is validated - read-only: the user is
		not allowed to change this property; write: the user has to specify
		this property; read/write: the user can overwrite the default property
		value. After you have the definition file ready, select it in the OPI
		Validation preferences page.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="rule">Validation Rules Definition</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Validation rules definition file is a regular properties file with a <i>.def</i>
		extension. You should define every rule in a single line and use '#'
		or '!' for line comments. There are three general rules definitions
		that each property can have:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>RO: The property is read-only and should not be changed by
			the user. Only the values from the schema are valid.</li>
		<li>WRITE: The property has to be specified by the user, which
			means that it has to have a value that is not an empty string or
			other undefined value.</li>
		<li>RW: User can change the property value. This is the default
			rule for all properties.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The rules should be defined for all properties of all widgets
		that should be validated. If the property is not listed here it is
		automatically assumed to be readable/writable. Each property can be
		either defined for all widget that have it, or for a specific widget.
		The widget specific definition will always have precedence over the
		general rule definition.</p>
	<p>
		Rules should be defined as <i>property=rule</i> pairs, where property
		is the name of the widget property (as it appears in the xml) and rule
		is one of the three options listed above. If you want to define a
		general rule (valid for all widgets), you should use only the property
		name. If you want to define a widget specific rule, you should prefix
		the property with the widget type and a dot. For example, if you wish
		to set the border color of all widgets to RO, you can write <i>border_color=RO</i>.
		If you wish to set it to RO only for the action button, you can write
		<i>actionbutton.border_color=RO</i>. Note that you can either use a
		full widget name (e.g. org.csstudio.opibuilder.widgets.ActionButton),
		or just the simple name. The rules are case insensitive. The property
		can also be defined as a regular expression; in this case any property
		that matches the regular expression will follow that rule (if there is
		no more specific rule for that property).
	</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>border_width=RO</i> - Border width of all widgets is
			defined by the schema.</li>
		<li><i>actionbutton.border_width=RW</i> - Border width of action
			button can be changed.</li>
		<li><i>trace_[0-9]+_trace_color=RO</i> - Trace color for any
			trace is defined by the schema.</li>
		<li><i>[a-z_0-9]*name=RO</i> - Any property ending with a 'name'
			is defined by schema.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Fonts and colors specified by the user are checked against the
		BOY font and color definition files.</p>
	<p>Rules can also specify additional acceptable values. These are
		the values that may or may be not identical to whatever is used in the
		OPI schema, but they are acceptable to be used for the specified
		property. For example: the OPI schema defined that the background
		color of a groupingContainer should be 'IO Background', however the
		value 'IO Area Background' is also acceptable. Acceptable values
		should be placed in rectangular brackets and separated by a
		semi-colon.</p>
	<p>
		<i>groupingContainer.background_color=RO [IO Background; IO Area
			Background]</i>
	</p>
	<p>Complex properties like rules, actions, and scripts can also
		have a rule, which states that certain sub property has to be removed
		if it is present. To apply such rule, append the name of that sub
		property to the rule definition in curly braces. For example: we want
		to remove all rules named BorderRule and NoBorder</p>
	<p>
		<i>rules=RW {BorderRule; NoBorder}</i>
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="failure">Validation Failures Severity</a>
	</h2>
	<p>Each validation failure is assigned one of the three possible
		severities: error, warning or info. Any RO rule violation is
		considered to be an error, unless it is a font or color property and
		the value that is used is one of the predefined values. WRITE
		violations have info severity, unless it is a font or color property
		and the value that was used is not one of the predefined values.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="preference">Preferences</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The Preferences page is available in <i>CSS Applications, Display,
			BOY, OPI Validation</i>.
	</p>
	<div class='figure'>
		<img src="preferences.png" />
	</div>
	<p>The following options are available:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Path to the validation rules definition file.</li>
		<li>Prompt user to do a backup of the file before every quick
			fix.</li>
		<li>If the prompt for backup is turned off, user can select
			whether to make backup automatically or not.</li>
		<li>Show summary dialog with statistics after the end of each
			validation.</li>
		<li>Nest validation failures in the problems view or show all
			failures in a flat style. Some properties (e.g. rules) have sub
			properties. If a failure in such sub property is discovered it can be
			nested under the parent property failure marker in the problems view.</li>
		<li>On each validation request old markers can be cleared from
			the problems view or not. If checked, the problems view will only
			show marker for the resources involved in the last validation. If not
			checked, problems view will show markers until they are fixed or CSS
			exits.</li>
		<li>When double clicking a marker in the problems view the
			failure can be displayed in the default editor for that file (e.g.
			OPI Editor) or in a text/XML editor.</li>
	</ul>
