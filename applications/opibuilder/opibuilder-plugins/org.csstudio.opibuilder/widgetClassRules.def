# The file lists all properties of all widgets that should be ignored or forced when 
# applying the class to a model. By default all properties will be set on the widget
# model. Any property that should be skipped should be listed in this definition file.
#
# The properties can be specified as simple properties (e.g. as name, pv_name, width), 
# which means they will be ignored for every widget. If the property is defined 
# as widgetType.propertyName it will be ignored only for the widget of that type
# (e.g. polyline.border_width). In addition you may also force applying a property
# for a specific widget, while it is set to be ignored for every other widget. In that
# case the definition should be given as widgetType.propertyName=force.

# The height property will be ignored for all widgets, except for the label
#! height
#! label.height=force

# You can also use regular expressions to define the properties. If you have a numbered property, 
# such as trace_0_trace_color, trace_1_trace_color, you can specify the name of the property
# using regular expression.  

#! trace_[0-9]+_trace_color
#! Or properties that ends with name
#! [a-zA-Z0-9_]*name

# The widget class and widget type will always be skipped for all widgets, unless they 
# are explicitly defined here.
# widget_class=force
# widget_type=force
