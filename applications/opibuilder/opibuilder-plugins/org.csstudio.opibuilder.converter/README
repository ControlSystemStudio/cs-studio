It may be useful to build a jar file from this plugin for batch conversion of
EDM files.  To do this, there is a build.xml file for ant.

This is intended to be executed using the Maven command

mvn verify -Dbuild.converter.jar

Running ant directly will probably fail, since Maven is required to download
required libraries into the target/ directory before ant can compile the jar
file.
