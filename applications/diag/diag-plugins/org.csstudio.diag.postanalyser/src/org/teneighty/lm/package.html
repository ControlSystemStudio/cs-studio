This package contains an implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares fitting algorithm.
This package manifest contains three pretty much unrelated sections:
<ol>
<li>How to use the <code>LevenbergMarquardt</code> class.</li>
<li>How to roll your own <code>Matrix</code> implementaion.</li>
<li>A description of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (i.e. why it works).</li>
</ol>


<h1>Using the <code>LevenbergMarquardt</code> Class</h1>

<h2>Length and Dimension</h2>
Every <code>LevenbergMarquardt</code> instance has an associated <i>length</i> and a <i>dimension</i>.
<i>Length</i> specifies the number of points your input data has, while <i>dimension</i>
specifies the dimension of each point. An important note here: The dimension of the input data
does <u>not</u> include the <i>values</i> of each data point. For example, suppose you
have a series of (x,y) points, and you wish to fit a function of the x-points to the y-values.
(Notice I've been very sneaky in my semantics, here.)
This would be considered <i>one dimensional</i> data, because the function you wish to
fit (i.e. something of the form <code>y=f(x)</code>) takes a vector of one dimension (each data
point has only a single component - x.
<p>
Here's a slightly more complex example: Suppose you have space-time points, i.e. three
spatial coordinates and a time coordinate; basically, you data looks something like this:
<br>
[ {x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>0</sub>},
 {x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>}, ... ,
 {x<sub>n-1</sub>, y<sub>n-1</sub>, z<sub>n-1</sub>, t<sub>n-1</sub>} ]
<br>
And you wish to fit a function <code>t=f(x,y,z)</code>. This would be considered data
of length <code>n</code> and dimension 3.
<p>
Basically, what I'm getting at here is that the dimension is simply the length of each
input vector minus one; this works because Levenberg-Marquardt works only with one-dimensional
cost functions (i.e., in the second example, it would not be possible to find a function
<code>&lt;t,x&gt=f(y,z)</code> - that is a vector function mapping <code>&lt;y,z&gt</code> vectors
to <code>&lt;t,x&gt</code> vectors.
