<h1>Channel Orchestrator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Channel Orchestrator.

<h2>Usage</h2>
The channel orchestrator is a tool to assist in preparing and writting a group of set points.
The Channel Finder query returns the a list of PVs, the table displays the properties and tags associated with the channel
along with their lower control limit, current value and upper control limit.
The weights are used to calculate the next set of setpoints for the channels.
The step count determines the number of steps to calculate (# of columns) where the value for each step is calculated as follows: <br/>
currentValue + (weight + stepSize + step number)<br/>
All the weights and the values caculated in the setpoint table are editable so as to be easily tweaked by the user.
The Apply button which is enabled only when there is a valid set of values available for write, will write the first set of values 
(the first column) when pressed.
