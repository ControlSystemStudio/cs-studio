<h1>Channel Tree by Property</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Channel Tree by Property allows to create an hierarchical view of the channels by using properties and their values.
It groups the channels returned by a query based on the value of the properties selected.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Type in a channel query. Press the button and configure the properties you would like to use.
Press apply when you are done. The first level of the tree will display the values for the first property,
the second level will display the values for the second property, and so on until all properties are used
and you end up with the channel names.
<p>
Only channels that actually have values for all properties are going to be displayed. Only property
values that are in the query result are going to be diplayed

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
Here we select all the channels from BPMs, vertical and horizontal correctors of the storage ring, and we organized
them based on cell, girder, element type and device name.

Here we change the order, and first organize them by element type, then by cell, girder and device name.
