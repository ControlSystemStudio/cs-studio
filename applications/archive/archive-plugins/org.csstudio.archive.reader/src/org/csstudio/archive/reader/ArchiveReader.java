/** Interface to archive data retrieval.
 *  <p>
 *  To get an actual implementation, use the ArchiveRepository.
 *  <p>
 *  Note that most methods in this API naturally require a network request
 *  or a lengthy search for data, so they will possibly take some time to
 *  complete.
 *  <p>
 *  Historic remark:
 *  Much of this code is based on the java archive viewer's
 *  data library, primarily written by Craig McChesney and Sergei Chevtsov,
 *  with contributions by Peregrine McGehee, all at LANL at the time.
 *  The first CSS implementation was in org.csstudio.archive.
 *  <p>
 *  The difference between this archive reader API and the previous CSS
 *  org.csstudio.archive implementation:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Samples are fetched via iterators, similar to JDBC.
 *      The old API returned an array of samples and would either run out of
 *      memory when trying to get a lot of data, or return only a fraction of
 *      the requested data, which in turn required another layer of code to
 *      iterate over 'batches' of partial results.
 *      This iterator-based API can be used to export virtually unlimited
 *      amounts of data, sample by sample, for computations or export
 *      to other data formats. It is up to the implementation to optimize
 *      the data transfer, for example like JDBC's internal fetch size.
 *  <li>Functionality that several data providers never actually implemented
 *      has been removed (start/end time of a channel's sample range)
 *  <li>Channel search via 'glob' pattern, which can be a lot faster than
 *      regular expression search, is directly supported.
 *  </ul>
