<h2>Select, move and resize</h2>
<p>To <strong>select widgets</strong>,
simply use the arrow keys (cursor keys) on your keyboard. By holding the Control
key down while pressing the arrow keys, you can change just the focus to another
widget without selecting it. You can then press Ctrl+Space to select widgets
individually. This allows you to select multiple widgets using the keyboard.

To <strong>move and resize</strong> widgets, press the period key. This will
switch the editor into the move mode for the currently selected widgets. Move
mode is indicated by an indicator icon displayed on top of the widget (see
screenshot). To commit the widget to its new position,
press enter. You can also press escape to cancel the move operation.
</p>

<p>By pressing the period key multiple times, you can cycle from move mode
through the different resize modes. The indicator icon will appear on top of
the respective resize handle.</p>
