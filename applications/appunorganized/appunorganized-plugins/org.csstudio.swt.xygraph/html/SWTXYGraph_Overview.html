	<h2>SWT XYGraph Overview</h2>
	<p>
	SWT XYGraph is an xy graph component based on 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Draw2D</a>, 
	which could be used not only in any SWT applications, 
	but also has the ability to be integrated in any <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">GEF</a> based applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	SWT XYGraph has most of the functionalities for an xy graph, 
	plot or chart in the field of science and engineering:

	<h4>Based on SWT/Draw2D</h4>
	<p>
		SWT XYGraph is based on <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Draw2D</a>, 
		if you implement Eclipse plug-ins, SWT-based stand alone applications or 
		<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">GEF</a> based projects, 
		SWT XYGraph would be the best candidate for your plot or chart functionality requirements.
	</p>
	<h4>Comprehensive functions and Easy to use</h4>
	<p>
		The APIs of adding/setting a trace or axis are quite straightforwardly. 
		Each part of the XYGraph(Trace, Axis, Grid, Annotation...) is a draw2d figure.
		You can easily hook listeners to any part or the whole XYGraph.  
		Besides, you can easily zoom, panning, take snapshot, add/remove annotation, configure all the graph components
		settings from the toolbar. Finally, all the operations are undo/redoable.
	</p>
	<h4>Light Weight and High Performance</h4>
	<p>Even with powerful functionality, the source code of SWT XYGraph is no more than 300KB. 
	It doesn't have any dependencies other than SWT and Draw2D. 
	For Eclipse user, the only additional required plug-in is Draw2D,
	 which can be easily downloaded from  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/tools/gef/downloads/drops/3.5.0/R200906221200/GEF-draw2d-sdk-3.5.0.zip">Eclispe official website.</a>
	There are also several design and algorithm optimization inside the code, 
	which bring us the high performance when drawing large amount of data.
