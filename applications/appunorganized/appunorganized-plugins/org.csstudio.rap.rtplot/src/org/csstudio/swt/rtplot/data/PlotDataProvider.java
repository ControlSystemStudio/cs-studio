/** A series of samples. Basically one 'line' in the plot.
 *  <p>
 *  Random access to samples is an important design criterion
 *  of the plot library.
 *  User code needn't copy its data into a plot-specific array,
 *  it only has to provide sample-by-sample access.
 *
 *  <p>The plot library iterates over the sample sequence
 *  to update annotations, auto-scale, and to redraw the plot.
 *  Concurrently, the application might receive new or
 *  changed samples.
 *  All users of the sample sequence thus need to lock.
 *
 *  <p>Note that the <code>size()</code> and <code>get()</code>
 *  themselves might not lock. Practical use of the data requires
 *  accessing several elements, and the reader needs to maintain
 *  the lock for the complete operation. Locking on each <code>get()</code>
 *  will not assert consistency but only increase CPU use for
 *  needless lock/unlocks.
 * *
 *  <p>To improve performance, the data provider implementation
 *  might internally use a {@link ReadWriteLock} for its write access to the data,
 *  and only pass the 'read' component to the plotting library.
 *
 *  @param <XTYPE> Data type used for the horizontal {@link Axis}
