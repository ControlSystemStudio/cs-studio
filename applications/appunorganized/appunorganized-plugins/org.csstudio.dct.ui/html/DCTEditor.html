<h1>DCT Perspective</h1>
<p>
<strong>Purpose: Database Creation Tool for EPICS-Databases</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This is not an introduction to EPICS but to the DCT perspective of the Control System Studio, therefore some experience with EPICS-based systems is necessary.<br>
</p>
<p>

Usually during the creation of EPICS-Databases a lot of redundant information has to be entered. The DCT perspective offers an editor and three views to aid in this task. A DCT-source file (this is an xml-file with the ending .css-dct) contains information about so-called <strong>prototypes</strong>, <strong>instances</strong> and <strong>records</strong>. The <strong>records</strong> are parameterized versions of EPICS records. The <strong>instances</strong> are used to create an EPICS-Database file, the <strong>prototypes</strong> are used to allow for easy construction of the instances. Prototypes are a means for structuring the system by grouping sets of parameters. Prototypes may be nested which gives you a lot of flexibility at hand. Based on the prototypes, instances are created. Instances represent EPICS-records. They are created by binding values to the parameters of the prototypes. Well, now we are about to try it ...<br>

<h2 id="AtfirstopentheDCTperspective">At first open the DCT perspective</h2>

<p>
<img src=010-Open_DCT_Perspective.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
After some work, the DCT perspective will look like this (reset the perspective if it does not show up with these views):<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=015-Newly_Opened_DCT_Perspective.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Most likely you will not have a DCT-source file at hand, so we will have to create one from scratch.<br>
</p>
<h2 id="Installthesampleproject">Install the sample project</h2>

<p>
To set up your working environment, you should install the sample projects. They will be used as the location for your own results and contain a DCT file as fallback where the result of this tutorial is provided.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=020-Install_Sample_Projects.png /><br/>
</p>
<h2 id="TheDCTfile">The DCT file</h2>
<p>
Now we are going to build the DCT file. Create a new file<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=030-Create_New_DCT_File.png /><br/>

</p>
<p>
name it MyDCT.css-dct and store it in the sample project folder.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=040-Name_And_Save_New_DCT_File.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
To provide the DCT with the metadata for the current EPICS version, you have to tell the DCT file which <strong>database definition file</strong> it shall use. 
Simply click into the value field of the <strong>DBD File Path</strong> property. The Resource Finder will open. Pick the <strong>test.dbd</strong> file:<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=045-Select_DBD_File.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
This step must not be forgotten. You will not be able to create any kind of item other than a folder, if you omit this step.<br>
</p>
<h2 id="Creatingitems">Creating items</h2>
<p>
In general you work from the outline view, using the context menu with the mouse.<br>
</p>
<p>

<img src=050-Creating_Items_In_Outline_View.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
There are four kinds of items you may create: <strong>Folders</strong>, <strong>Instances</strong>, <strong>Prototypes</strong> and <strong>Records</strong>.<br>
</p>
<p>
Folders are the usual means for organizing your items, there is nothing special about them. For a larger system you may want to create folders to separate Prototypes and Instances, so let us start this way for this demo too. The following outline already contains these folders.<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=055-Creating_Folders.png /><br/>
</p>
<h2 id="Creatingaprototype">Creating a prototype</h2>
<p>
In the prototype folder, you create a prototype using the context menu. In the editor several form fields grouped in sections will show up. You should enter a telling name in the Name field (in the <strong>Common Settings</strong> section), this will be used for identifying your prototype inside DCT.
For the time being, nothing will be entered in the <strong>Properties</strong> section, so it may be left collapsed.<br>

</p>
<p>
The <strong>Parameter</strong> section makes up the essential section. Here you enter the names of the parameters which you may later give values to to create instances. Sounds complicated? Not at all. We are going to create a simple generator for a sawtooth function. The following parameters will come in handy:<br>
</p>
<ul><li><strong>dispMin, dispMax</strong> give the bounds of the display
</li><li><strong>lolo, hihi</strong> give the bounds of the major alarm zone
</li><li><strong>lo, hi</strong> give the bounds of the minor alarm zone

</li><li><strong>minVal, maxVal</strong> give the bounds of the value of the sawtooth function
</li><li><strong>name</strong> is what you might expect
</li><li><strong>increment</strong> defines the step for the sawtooth function
</li></ul><p>
Now enter the parameter names, using the button with the plus sign at the bottom left.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=060-Entering_Properties_For_Sawtooth_Prototype.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>

How will it fit together? We just defined a prototype containing several parameter names. We are just about to define a record which will make use of the parameters. Later on we will create instances (resulting in EPICS records) by giving values to the parameters. This way the same prototype is used for the creation of several EPICS records.<br>
</p>
<h2 id="Addingarecordtotheprototype">Adding a record to the prototype</h2>
<p>
Ok, let us go. Add a record for the prototype using the context menu of the outline view. You have to chose the type of the record. Select a calc record type.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=065-Creating_Record_For_Sawtooth_Prototyp.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Now we have to define the calc record based on the parameters. Most important are the Name and the Epics Name, the latter being based on the <strong>name parameter</strong> of the prototype. Enter them like shown here<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=067-Entering_EPICSName_Into_Prototype_Record.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Now you may enter the other fields. First define the DESC field, let us give it the Epics Name too. You will notice the autocompletion after entering the $-sign.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=070-Autocompletion_For_Properties.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Please enter the following values to the appropriate fields (for the calculation part) as shown here<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=075-Entering_Calculation_For_SawCalc_Record.png /><br/>

</p>
<p>
and for the alarm parameters as shown here<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=080-Entering_Alarm_Parameters_For_SawCalc_Record.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
You end up with a fully specified prototype which you may use to create instances.
</p>
<h2 id="Creatinganinstance">Creating an instance</h2>
<p>
Add an instance to the Instance folder<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=090-Creating_Instance_Of_SawCalc.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
You will be asked which prototype your instance will be based on<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=100-Selecting_Prototype_For_Instance_Of_SawCalc.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Select the only one which is currently available. The unbound parameters of the prototype are shown in the Parameter Values section of the editor. <br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=105-Showing_Unbound_Parameters_For_SawCalc_Instance.png /><br/>

</p>
<p>
You have to bind values to the parameters (tab key proceedes to the next value field) like this:<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=110-Entering_Parameters_For_SawCalc_Instance.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Don’t forget to give a name to the instance, it will show up in the outline view. <br>
</p>
<h2 id="Creatingasecondinstance">Creating a second instance</h2>
<p>

Now we will make use of the prototype by creating a similar instance. Select Copy in the outline view.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=120-Copying_SawCalc0_Instance.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
and paste the instance alongside the existing instance.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=130-Pasting_Instance_Of_SawCalc_Into_Instances_Folder.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Whoops.</strong> An error is shown:<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=140-Outline_After_Pasting_Instance.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
You will find help. There is an explanation in the problem view<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=145-Problems_After_Pasting_Instance.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Quite right, there may not be two EPICS records with the same name. We are going to correct this, thereby providing different parameter values and a different name as well.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=150-Entering_Different_Parameter_Values_For_Second_Instance.png /><br/>

</p>
<p>
Now everything looks ok. 
</p>
<h2 id="Takingalookattheinstanceview">Taking a look at the instance view</h2>
<p>
In the Instance View (bottom right) you can see, which instances rely on the selected prototype. This is great for a reasonably sized system.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=160-Showing_Instances_Of_Prototype_Sawtooth.png /><br/>
</p>
<h2 id="CreatingtheEPICSdatabase">Creating the EPICS database</h2>

<p>
Finally we are going to create the EPICS database file. Simply select the <strong>Preview DB-File</strong> tab at the bottom of the editor pane. Skim through the EPICS database and save it using the <strong>Save To File</strong>-button.<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=170-Exporting_DB_File_For_SoftIOC.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Usually the extension .db is used for EPICS database files so we will give the result the name <strong>AlarmDemo.db</strong>. Please don't use a different name here, because this name is expected in the EPICS configuration of the Soft-IOC used later.<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=175-Save_DB_File.png /><br/>
</p>
<h2 id="RunningtheSoft-IOC">Running the Soft-IOC</h2>
<p>
This database can be run in a so-called SoftIOC (this is supported only under Windows). Copy <strong>SoftIOC.zip</strong> from the Sample Project Folder to some other place (e.g. C:\SoftIOC) and unzip it. Now copy <strong>AlarmDemo.db</strong> into the demo folder. Then start the SoftIOC with the <strong>RunSoftIOC.bat</strong> command. To stop it, simply type <strong>exit</strong> at its prompt.<br>

</p>
<h2 id="FinallywatchingtheIOCwork">Finally watching the IOC work</h2>
<p>
Now you can take a look at the two sawtooth generators. Select the <strong>CSS Standard perspective</strong> and start two <strong>Probe</strong> views (the second one will open when you press the control key too) and an <strong>EPICS PV Hierarchy</strong>, all from the <strong>CSS</strong>-&gt;<strong>Diagnostic Tools</strong> menu. The EPICS-Names are well known to you (SawCalc0/1 resp.). If not, have a look at the names with the selection <strong>Record Names</strong> from the combobox in the upper left corner of the <strong>Preview DB-File</strong> tab

</p>
<p>
<img src=190-Showing_Record_Names.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
You will need to arrange the views properly to achieve the following layout:<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=200-Standard_Perspective_With_Two_Instances.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Watching the generators do their work will hopefully be a reward for all your activities.<br>
</p>
<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
If something fails, you may use the demo database named <strong>SimpleDemo.db</strong>. It is already contained in the SoftIOC, so you only have to start the SoftIOC running <strong>RunSoftIOC.bat</strong> as explained above. There is a file named <strong>st.cmd</strong> in the demo subfolder, which contains the initialization for the SoftIOC. Here is a snippet from that file:
</p>
<pre class="wiki"># Loading the demo databases
dbLoadRecords("./SimpleDemo.db")
dbLoadRecords("./AlarmDemo.db")
</pre><p>
The database <strong>SimpleDemo.db</strong> is already at its correct place. If you have trouble installing <strong>AlarmDemo.db</strong> you may comment out the line

</p>
<pre class="wiki">#dbLoadRecords("./AlarmDemo.db")
</pre><p>
To find out about the existing EPICS record names you may load the demo database into the editor. It will tell you this:<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src=210-Showing_Record_Names_Of_SimpleDemo.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Now you may use <strong>Probe</strong> and <strong>EPICS PV Hierarchy</strong> again to inspect the running SoftIOC.

</p>
<p>
There is also a file named <strong>MyDCTReady.css-dct</strong>, which contains the result of this tutorial so far.
</p>
<h2 id="DefiningPrototypesusingPrototypes">Defining Prototypes using Prototypes</h2>
<p>
Now we are going to take a look at the <strong>SimpleDemo.css-dct</strong>. Please load it into the editor, if not already done. You will notice another prototype with the name <strong>SawAndIncr</strong> and two instances named <strong>SawAndIncr0/1</strong>.<br>

</p>
<p>
<img src=220-Showing_Outline_Of_SimpleDemo.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Select the prototype <strong>SawAndIncr</strong> in the outline. The instance view will tell you, that indeed the two new instances are derived from this prototype.
</p>
<p>
<img src=230-Showing_Instances_Of_SawAndIncr_Prototype.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
To define such a structured beast, proceed in the following way:
</p>
<ul><li>Add a new prototype and give it a name.

</li><li>Now add an <strong>instance</strong> to the new prototype. You will be asked, which prototype the instance should be based on.
</li><li>For this example, the Sawtooth prototype has been selected.
</li><li>Along with the newly created instance of Sawtooth, a record (called <strong>Incrementer</strong>) is added. It will give us a sequence of numbers. This record is again of type <strong>calc</strong>. Inspect its fields, esp. the <strong>Epics Name</strong> in the <strong>Common Settings</strong> section and the calculation (delivering 1, 3, 7, 15 and so on).
</li><li>In the <strong>SawAndIncr0</strong> instance, only the instance name is defined.

<ul><li>In the local <strong>Sawtooth instance</strong>, the usual parameters are defined, setting the ranges.
</li><li>The <strong>name</strong> is bound to the name from the outer scope.
</li><li>But the <strong>increment</strong> no longer is given as a constant as in the previously defined instances, but uses the local incrementer as a function.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<img src=240-Showing_Parameters_Of_Sawtooth_Instance.png /><br/>
</p>
<p>
Finally you may want to watch these EPICS records in the <strong>Probe</strong> and <strong>EPICS PV Hierarchy</strong> view.
