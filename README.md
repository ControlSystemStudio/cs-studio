Control System Studio is a collections of tools to monitor and operate large scale control systems, such as the ones in the accelerator community.

This repository is for the original, Eclipse-based implementation of CS-Studio.
A newer development provides most of the key CS-Studio components
without any Eclipse dependencies, see https://github.com/shroffk/phoebus
It generally offers faster startup, and also dramatically simplifies the
build process.

### Building CS-Studio

This repository contains all the code for building CS-Studio. However, there is a two-step
build process.

```
# Build maven-osgi-bundles to ensure all bundles are available for Tycho resolution.
mvn -f maven-osgi-bundles/pom.xml clean verify
# Build everything else.
mvn clean verify -Dcsstudio.composite.repo=$(pwd)/p2repo
```

You can use `-DskipTests=true` to speed up the build process.
