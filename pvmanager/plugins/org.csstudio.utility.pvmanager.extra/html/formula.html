        <h1>Formulas</h1>
        
        A formula can be a simple pv, or an = followed by an expression. The
        expression allows to combine readings from multiple pvs.

        <h2>Simple pvs</h2>
        Any string of text that does not start with = or ' is considered a pv:
<pre>mypv123    : the pv called "mypv123"
mypv+123   : the pv called "mypv+123"
123        : the pv called "123"</pre>
        Pvs can also be expressed in single quotes:
<pre>'mypv123'  : the pv called "mypv123"
'mypv+123' : the pv called "mypv+123"
'123'      : the pv called "123"</pre>
        <p>
        <h2>Formulas</h2>
        Any string of text that starts with = must be followed by and expression.
        <p>
            Pvs in expressions must be single quoted:
<pre>='mypv123'  : the pv called "mypv123"
='mypv+123' : the pv called "mypv+123"
='123'      : the pv called "123"</pre>
            Escaped text is supported within the single quotes with the same
            definitions as in Java. For example \n for new line, \" for double
            quotes, \' for single quotes and so on.
        <p>
            Expressions can contain numeric and string constants. Their definition
            matches Java.
<pre>="Some text" : a constant string
=123         : the constant integer 123
=3.14        : the constant double 3.14
=1e5         : the constant double 100,000 in exponential notation</pre>
        <p>
            Expressions can be combined with operators and functions.
<pre>=1000 * 'mypv' + 300 : the value from a pv called "mypv" multiplied by 1,000 and summed to 300
=log('mypv')         : the logarithm of the pv called "mypv"
=arrayOf(1,2,3,4,5)  : an array containing the first 5 integers</pre>
        <h2>Reference in Control System Studio</h2>
            Since operators and functions can be added dynamically, we can't
            provide a full list here. In Control System Studio you can consult the Formula Function
            browser (CSS -> Debugging -> Formula Function)
