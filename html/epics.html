<h1>EPICS Library</h1>
This provides the ChannelAccess client library
for accessing Process Variables on EPICS IOCs.
<p>
There is a preference page for basic configuration,
where the address list is of primary interest:<br>
Set it to the IP addresses of IOCs or IOC subnets.
Refer to the EPICS Channel Access reference manual
for details.

<h2>Nerdy Details</h2>
This uses the 'pure java' version, CAJ.
It caused hangups on SNS IOCs, so it is not
advisable for production.
<p>
See org.csstudio.utility.pv for a utility wrapper.
<p>
Note that this includes only the pure Java client code.
In addition, one typically also needs the 'caRepeater'.
This code does not include the very latest, pure java CA repeater,
so you probably have to launch the 'native' version of the
repeater for e.g. Win32 yourself before running a CSS app
that uses the CA client library.
