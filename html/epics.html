<h1>EPICS Library</h1>
This provides the ChannelAccess (CA) client library
for accessing Process Variables on EPICS IOCs
via the network.

<h2>Preferences</h2>
There are two main items to configure:
<ul>
<li>JCA Context:<br>
    There is a pure Java as well as a JNI implementation
    available.
    The pure Java version is easier to install and should
    work "out of the box", while the JNI implementation
    might provide maximum compatibility with existing
    EPICS installations.
<li>addr_list and auto_addr_list:<br>
    Unless all CA servers (IOCs) are on the same subnet
    as the CSS application, you need to list the IP addresses
    of IOCs or IOC subnets, and un-check the auto_addr_list.
    For details on this as well as the remaining settings,
    refer to the EPICS Channel Access reference manual.
</ul>
<p>
Note that changes require a restart of the application,
they do not take effect at runtime!

<h2>Installation</h2>
When using the 'pure java' version, aka. CAJ,
no additional steps should be required.
<p>
To use the JNI version, you need to install OS-specific binaries.
This plugin currently includes binaries for:
<ul>
<li>RedHat Linux (x86, g++ 3.4.4, kernel 2.6.9-22.EL)
<li>Mac OS X (PPC)
</ul>
To install them, you need to locate the org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics
plugin file in the "plugin" subdirectory of your Eclipse installation.
Unzip it, and install the shared libraries from
the "os/..." subdirectory for your architecture,
for example "os/linux/x86".
You can either copy them to a location in the file system that your
OS searches by default ("/lib" on Linux or OS X),
or copy them to a location of your choice
like "$HOME/lib" and then list that location in
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
DYNLIB_LIBRARY_PATH (OS X) or PATH (Windows).

<h2>References</h2>
The CAJ and JCA sources as well as more details are available from 
<a href="http://www.cosylab.com">http://www.cosylab.com</a>.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
The JCA JNI binaries were built from the jca-2.3.0 sources,
with all DetachCurrentThread() calls in JNI.cpp commented out.
This had to be done to avoid a memory leak in DetachCurrentThread(),
but is obviously not perfect, since these DetachCurrentThread() calls
were originally added for a reason.
