<h1>EPICS Library</h1>
This provides the ChannelAccess (CA) client library
for accessing Process Variables on EPICS IOCs
via the network.

<h2>Preferences</h2>
There are two main items to configure:
<ul>
<li>JCA Context:<br>
    There is a pure Java as well as a JNI implementation
    available.
    The pure Java version is easier to install and should
    work "out of the box", while the JNI implementation
    might provide maximum compatibility with existing
    EPICS installations.
<li>addr_list and auto_addr_list:<br>
    Unless all CA servers (IOCs) are on the same subnet
    as the CSS application, you need to list the IP addresses
    of IOCs or IOC subnets, and un-check the auto_addr_list.
    For details on this as well as the remaining settings,
    refer to the EPICS Channel Access reference manual.
</ul>
<p>
Note that changes require a restart of the application,
they do not take effect at runtime!

<h2>Installation</h2>
When using the 'pure java' version, aka. CAJ,
no additional steps should be required.
<p>
When using the JNI version, the OS-specific binaries
need to be installed from a subfolder "libs/JCA"
of the plugin source tree.
<p>
The symptom for not installing them properly:
Error messages including "Context not initialized"
whenever access to EPICS PVs is attempted.
<ul>
<li>RedHat Linux (x86, g++ 3.4.4, kernel 2.6.9-22.EL):<br>
    From the "linux-x86" subfolder, copy all shared libraries to
    a location of your choice, for example "~/lib",
    and set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include
    that location.
<li>Mac OS X (PPC):<br>
    From the "osx-ppc" subfolder, copy
    "libjca.jnilib" to "~/Library/Java/Extensions".
    Copy the other shared libraries to a location of your choice,
    for example "~/lib",
    and set the environment variable DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH to include
    that location.
<li>Other:<br>
    You need to obtain sources for EPICS base
    and JCA, and build the binaries yourself. See references.
</ul>

<h2>References</h2>
The CAJ and JCA sources as well as more details are available from 
<a href="http://www.cosylab.com">http://www.cosylab.com</a>.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
The JCA JNI binaries were built from the jca-2.3.0 sources,
with all DetachCurrentThread() calls in JNI.cpp commented out.
This had to be done to avoid a memory leak in DetachCurrentThread(),
but is obviously not perfect, since these DetachCurrentThread() calls
were originally added for a reason.
