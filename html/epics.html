<h1>EPICS Library</h1>
This provides the ChannelAccess (CA) client library
for accessing Process Variables on EPICS IOCs
via the network.

<h2>Preferences</h2>
There are two main items to configure:
<ul>
<li>JCA Context:<br>
    There is a pure Java as well as a JNI implementation
    available.
    The pure Java version is the default because it is
    easier to install and should
    work "out of the box", while the JNI implementation
    might provide maximum compatibility with existing
    EPICS installations.
<li>addr_list and auto_addr_list:<br>
    If all CA servers (IOCs) are on the same subnet
    as the computer running the CSS application,
    you can stay with the default: Empty addr_list,
    using auto_addr_list.
    Otherwise, if you need to access PVs on a gateway or
    in another subnet, list the IP addresses
    of IOCs or IOC subnets in the addr_list,
    and un-check the auto_addr_list.
    For details on this as well as the remaining settings,
    refer to the EPICS Channel Access reference manual.
</ul>
<p>
Note that changes require a restart of the application,
they do not take effect at runtime!

<h2>Installation</h2>
When using the 'pure java' version, aka. CAJ,
no additional steps should be required.
<p>
To use the JNI version, you need to install OS-specific binaries.
This plugin currently includes binaries for:
<ul>
<li>RedHat Linux (x86, g++ 3.4.4, kernel 2.6.9-22.EL)<br>
    Build 2006, Dec 20 with EPICS base R3.14.7 from the jca-2.3.0 sources.
    R3.14.8.2 resulted in error messages related to
    "exception during virtual circuit creation"
    after closing all channels and then trying to create new ones.
<li>Mac OS X (10.4.8 on PPC)<br>
    Build 2006, Dec 20 with EPICS base R3.14.8.2 from the jca-2.3.0 sources.
</ul>
Locate the org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics
plugin file in the "plugin" subdirectory of your Eclipse installation.
Unzip it, and install the shared libraries from
the "os/..." subdirectory for your architecture,
for example "os/linux/x86".
You can either copy them to a location in the file system that your
OS searches by default ("/lib" on Linux or OS X),
or copy them to a location of your choice
like "$HOME/lib" and then list that location in
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (OS X) or PATH (Windows).
