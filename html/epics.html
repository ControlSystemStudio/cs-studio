<h1>EPICS Library</h1>
This provides the ChannelAccess (CA) client library
for accessing Process Variables on EPICS IOCs
via the network.

<h2>Preferences</h2>
There are two main items to configure:
<ul>
<li>JCA Context:<br>
    There is a pure Java as well as a JNI implementation
    available.
    The pure Java version is easier to install and should
    work "out of the box", while the JNI implementation
    might provide maximum compatibility with existing
    EPICS installations.
<li>addr_list and auto_addr_list:<br>
    Unless all CA servers (IOCs) are on the same subnet
    as the CSS application, you need to list the IP addresses
    of IOCs or IOC subnets, and un-check the auto_addr_list.
    For details on this as well as the remaining settings,
    refer to the EPICS Channel Access reference manual.
</ul>
<p>
Note that changes require a restart of the application,
they do not take effect at runtime!

<h2>Installation</h2>
When using the 'pure java' version, aka. CAJ,
no additional steps should be required.
<p>
To use the JNI version, the OS-specific binaries
need to be available as well. If you select the JNI context
and get error messages including "Context not initialized"
whenever access to EPICS PVs is attempted, you lack the proper
JNI binaries. This plugin currently includes binaries for these:
<ul>
<li>RedHat Linux (x86, g++ 3.4.4, kernel 2.6.9-22.EL)
<li>Mac OS X (PPC)
</ul>

<h2>References</h2>
The CAJ and JCA sources as well as more details are available from 
<a href="http://www.cosylab.com">http://www.cosylab.com</a>.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
The JCA JNI binaries were built from the jca-2.3.0 sources,
with all DetachCurrentThread() calls in JNI.cpp commented out.
This had to be done to avoid a memory leak in DetachCurrentThread(),
but is obviously not perfect, since these DetachCurrentThread() calls
were originally added for a reason.
