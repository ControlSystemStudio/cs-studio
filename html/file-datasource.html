        <h1>File DataSource</h1>

        <h2>PV syntax</h2>
        <p>
            The standard prefix for the datasource is <code>file://</code> which can be omitted if configured as the default datasource.
        </p>
        <p>
            This datasource allows to read files and treat the contents as a
            source of data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>On Windows: <code>file:///C:/Users/carcassi/mydata.csv</code> will open the file located at <code>C:\Users\carcassi\mydata.csv</code></li>
            <li>On Unix: <code>file:///home/foo/mydata.csv</code> will open the file located at <code>/home/foo/mydata.csv</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Current limitations</h2>
        <p>
            It currently does not detect when the file content changes, and there is
            no way to "refresh" except connecting and disconnecting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only supported format is CSV and the data is read as a table.
            The first line represents the column names and the subsequent lines
            represents rows of the table. Each element is separated by a space.
            Strings must be quoted with a double quote.
        </p>
