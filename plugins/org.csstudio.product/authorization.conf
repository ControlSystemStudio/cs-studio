# Configure authorizations and users who have them
# based on user name patterns

# Format:
# authorization = pattern for users, pattern for users, ...
#
# Authorizations are defined by applications.
# For example, the alarm system GUI might require the "alarm_acknowledge"
# authorization for acknowledging an alarm.
#
# In addition, the authorization "FULL" covers everything.
#
# User patterns are regular expressions.
# Multiple patterns are separated by ",".
# Each pattern itself must not contain a ",".

# Anybody can acknowledge alarms
alarm_acknowledge=.*

# Specific users may configure alarms
alarm_config = 

# The following would allow anybody to do anything
FULL = .*
