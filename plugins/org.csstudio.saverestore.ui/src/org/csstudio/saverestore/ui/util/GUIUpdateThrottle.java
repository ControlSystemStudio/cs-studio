/**
 * GUI Update throttle
 * <p>
 * Assume that the GUI sometimes receives an update that should be processed right away. At other times it receives a
 * burst of updates, where it would be best to wait a little and then redraw to show "everything" instead of reacting to
 * each single update right away which only results in flicker and may even be much slower overall.
 * <p>
 * This class delays the first update a little bit, so in case it's a burst, those updates accumulate. Then it updates,
 * and suppresses further updates for a while to limit flicker. Finally, it starts over.
