	** Colormap file .xml **

The preferred format for colormaps is the native xml description. A valid .xml
colormap should specify whether the colormap uses a "absolute" or a "relative" scale
(specified in the position atrribute),what the nanColor is(specified in the colorNaN attribute),
and a list of positions and the corresponding color.

If a relative scale is used, then the value field in value can only contains decimal
values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. If an absolute scale is chosen, then the value can be
any number. However, the position value can only be in increasing order.

In terms of color representation in this .xml file, Graphene recognizes all of the following formats:

1. Any standard HTML color name
(which can be found at http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp) example:blue,orange,aliceblue,aqua,etc

2. An HTML long or short format hex string with an optional hex alpha channel.
Hexadecimal values may be preceded by either "0x" or "#" and can either be 2 digits
 in the range 00 to 0xFF or a single digit in the range 0 to F. example:0xff668840,#f68

3. An rgb(r,g,b) or rgba(r,g,b,a) format string. Each of the r, g, or b values
can be an integer from 0 to 255 or a floating point percentage value from 0.0 to 100.0
followed by the percent (%) character. The alpha component, if present, is a
floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0. example: rgb(255,102,136), rgb(100%,50%,50%)

4. An hsl(h,s,l) or hsla(h,s,l,a) format string. The h value is a floating point
number from 0.0 to 360.0 representing the hue angle on a color wheel in degrees
with 0.0 or 360.0 representing red, 120.0 representing green, and 240.0 representing
blue. The s value is the saturation of the desired color represented as a floating
point percentage from gray (0.0) to the fully saturated color (100.0) and the l value
is the desired lightness or brightness of the desired color represented as
a floating point percentage from black (0.0) to the full brightness of the
color (100.0). The alpha component, if present, is a floating point value
from 0.0 to 1.0. Spaces are allowed before or after the numbers and between the
percentage number and its percent sign (%). example: hsl(240,100%,100%), hsla(120,0%,0%,0.25)
