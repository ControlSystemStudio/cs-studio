    <!-- This file controls the configuration of how the different data sources
        are combined and made accessible to DIIRT.

        The composite data source allows multiple data sources to be
        made available by breaking up the channel name into three parts:
            [dataSourceName][delimiter][channelName]
        It also allows to set a default data source so that names that do not
        match the pattern are forwarded to the datasource. Effectively:
            [umatchedChannelName] -> [defaultDataSource][delimiter][unmatchedChannelName]

        By default, the delimiter is ://
        By default, there is no default data source. -->
    <!--<compositeDataSource delimiter="://" />-->

    <!-- This changes the default data source to Channel Access, while leaving
        the default delimiter to :// -->
    <!--<compositeDataSource defaultDataSource="ca" />-->
</dataSources>
