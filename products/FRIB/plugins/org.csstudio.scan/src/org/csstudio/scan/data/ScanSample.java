/** A sample taken by a scan
 *
 *  <p>All samples have a time stamp.
 *
 *  <p>A serial number is used to track the sequence
 *  in which samples were acquired within a scan.
 *  The time stamps alone can <u>not</u> dependably correlate
 *  samples for several reasons:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Time stamps can be the actual control system time stamps.
 *      If a value has not changed for a while, the 'old' time stamp
 *      would reflect that.
 *  <li>A scan can run faster than the resolution of the time stamp.
 *  <li>Samples are meant to be logged "together", for example by one
 *      log command within a loop, but their actual time stamps
 *      don't reflect that.
 *  </ul>
