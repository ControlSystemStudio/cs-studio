/** Helper for creating a sequence of commands
 *
 *  <p>Used by the client to build a sequence of commands
 *  which is then submitted to the server for execution as a "scan".
 *
 *  <p>Allows both <code>List&lt;Command></code> and plain <code>Command[]</code>.
 *  For Java code collections like <code>List</code>
 *  are most convenient. Jython nicely converts existing collections
 *  into a python list, but it is harder to create collections
 *  from a python list, so arrays are also accepted.
