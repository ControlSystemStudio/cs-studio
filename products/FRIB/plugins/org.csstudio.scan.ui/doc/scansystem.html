<h1>Scan System</h1>

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2> 

<p>The scan system can automate experiments.
For example, it can move a motor from some start
position to an end position in certain steps,
waiting at each step until experiment data has been taken.
</p>

<p>A scan can consist of several nested loops.
For example, at each step of moving the "horizontal"
position of a sample, an inner loop can vary the
"vertical" position of the sample to perform a
2-dimensional scan of the sample surface.
As another example, an outer loop may vary the sample
temperature while inner loops vary the sample position.
</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the scan system
uses separate tools to define a scan, to execute a scan
and to monitor it:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Scans are configured via a control system panel,
a scan editor, or a script.
</li>
<li>The commands of a scan are then submitted
to a Scan Server for execution.
</li>
<li>You can monitor the execution of a scan in various ways.
</li>
</ol>

<p>This design allows scans to execute even if the
original control system panel has been closed.
Scans can be monitored, paused or aborted 
independent from the computer that submitted the scans.
</p>

<h2><a name="logging">Logging</a></h2> 

<p>The scan system includes a simple logging system that
can for example log the position of motors that are operated
by a scan. By monitoring this log, you can track the progress
of running scans, or verify the operation of completed scans by
inspecting their saved log data.
</p>

<p>To add samples to the log, you place <a href="#LogCommand">Log Commands</a>
in your scan. The <a href="#LogConfig">Log Mode</a> commands can further influence
how samples are logged.
</p>

<p>To view logged data, use the
<a href="doc/scansystem.html#plot">Scan Plot</a>
or
<a href="doc/scansystem.html#scan_data">Scan Data Display</a>.
</p>

<p>The scan log is <u>not</u> a complete data acquisition system
but a tool to monitor the progress of a scan.
Commands in a scan can instruct a data acquisition system to start taking data,
or to stop data acquisition at the end of a scan.
This way, the scan system can interact with a data acquisition
system, but each can also be used independently:
You can automate an experiment without acquiring data,
or acquire data while manually operating the experiment.
</p>


<h2><a name="commands">Commands</a></h2> 

<img alt="Example Scan" src="scan_example.png"/>

<p>The picture above shows a scan with two nested loops
as it would appear in the <a href="#editor">Scan Editor</a>.
What follows is a description of all available commands.
</p>


<h3><a name="SetCommand"><img alt="set" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/setcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Set Command</a></h3>
<p>This command sets a device to a desired value.
</p>
<p>In addition to sending the desired value to the device,
it can also wait for the device or an associated read-back device
to actually reach the desired value.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Name of the device to set.</li>
<li>Value: Desired value of the device.</li>
<li>Wait for readback: By default, the command will wait until the device reaches the commanded value.</li>
<li>Readback Device: By default, the Device where the value was written is also checked for reaching the commanded value.
    Optionally, a different "read back" device can be used.</li>
<li>Tolerance: Difference between the actual value of the device and the desired value
    that is considered "good enough".</li>
<li>Timeout: Time in seconds that the command will wait for the device (or separate read back) to reach
    the commanded value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
<code>Set 'setpoint' = 1.0</code>
will write the value 1.0 to the "setpoint" device.
</p>
<p>
<code>Set 'setpoint' = 1.0 (wait for 'readback' +-0.1, 10.0 sec timeout)</code>
will also write the value 1.0 to the "setpoint" device.
In addition to the previous example the command will wait up to 10 seconds
for the "readback" device to reach the value of 1.0 with a tolerance of 0.1,
that is a value within 0.9 and 1.0.
</p>


<h3><a name="WaitCommand"><img alt="wait" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/waitcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Wait Command</a></h3>
<p>This command waits for a device to reach a desired value.
</p>
<p>The Set command described above already contains similar functionality,
but it can only wait for a device to reach the absolute value to which it
has been commanded.
The separate wait command can be used to wait for a <i>different</i>
value, or to wait for a device to increase or decrease by a certain value.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Name of the device to set.</li>
<li>Comparison: How the current value of the device is compared to the desired value.
    Options include equal, less than etc. as well as "increase by" or "decrease by"
    for comparisons relative to the original value of the device at the time when
    the command is becoming active.</li>
<li>Desired Value: Desired value of the device.</li>
<li>Tolerance: Difference between the actual value of the device and the desired value
    that is considered "good enough".</li>
<li>Timeout: Time in seconds that the command will wait for the device to reach
    the desired value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<p>
<code>Wait for 'readback' = 1.0 (+-0.1)</code>
will wait until the value of the "readback" device reaches the value 1.0+-0.1,
i.e. is within the range of 0.9 ... 1.1.
Because of rounding errors and control system noise you should never
set the tolerance to 0.0 for the equality ('=') check,
because your device might never reach the exact desired value.
Configure a small tolerance like 0.001 to allow for rounding errors.
</p>
<p>
<code>Wait for 'readback' > 5.0</code>
will wait until the value of the "readback" device
is above 5.0.
</p>
<p>
<code>Wait for 'readback' to increase by 5.0</code>
will wait until the value of the "readback" device
increases by 5.0.
Assuming that the value was 10.0 when we reached this
wait command, the value would have to grow to at least
15.0 for the wait command to finish.
</p>


<h3><a name="LoopCommand"><img alt="loop" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/loopcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Loop Command</a></h3>
<p>This command changes a device from a start to an end value.
It is at the core of most scans.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Name of the device to set.</li>
<li>Initial Value: Initial value of the device.</li>
<li>Final Value: Final value of the device.</li>
<li>Step Size: Step in which value of device should be changed.</li>
<li>Wait for readback: By default, the loop will wait until the device reaches the commanded value.</li>
<li>Readback Device: By default, the loop device to which the loop writes is also checked for reaching the commanded value.
    Optionally, a different "read back" device can be used.</li>
<li>Tolerance: Difference between the actual value of the device and the desired value
    that is considered "good enough".</li>
<li>Timeout: Time in seconds that the command will wait for the device (or separate read back) to reach
    the commanded value.</li>
<li>Body: Commands to be executed at each step of the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Loop 'xpos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code>
will set the "xpos" device to 0.0, then 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0.
At each step it will execute the "body" of the loop.
</p>
<p>Loops can count "up" as well as "down".
A loop from 0 to 5 in steps of 1 will operate as just mentioned.
A loop from 5 to 0 in steps of -1 will assume values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
When specifying a step direction that does <u>not</u> match
the loop direction, for example a loop from 0 to 5 in steps of -1,
the loop will have a special behavior:
It will toggle its direction each time it is executed.
This can be useful for nested loops that are intended to scan a surface,
as shown in the diagram below:
</p>

<img alt="Example for alternate scan" src="scan_alternate.png" width="90%"/>

<p>The normal scan displayed in the left diagram was executed with nested loops</p>
<p>
<code>Loop 'xpos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Loop 'ypos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code>
</p>

<p>The alternating scan displayed to the right was executed with nested loops</p>
<p>
<code>Loop 'xpos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Loop 'ypos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step -1.0</code>
</p>
<p>causing the inner loop on "ypos" to alternate direction each time is is executed.
If these "xpos" and "ypos" devices are for example connected to stepper motors,
the alternating scan will be faster and reduce wear on the motors.
</p>


<h3><a name="IncludeCommand"><img alt="include" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/includecommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Include Command</a></h3>
<p>Include another <code>*.scn</code> file in a scan.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan File: Name of the scan file</li>
<li>Macros: Macros</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Include 'other.scn', macro1=value1,macro2=value2</code>
will include the scan defined in <code>other.scn</code> and execute it with the given macros.
</p>
<p>The path to the scan file must either be a complete path within the file system,
or - preferably - a file in one of the directories listed in the scan server
search path preference.
</p>
<p>Macros specified in an include command are added to the existing macros.
Macros of the same name as existing macros replace their value.
</p>


<h3><a name="LogCommand"><img alt="log" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/logcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Log Command</a></h3>
<p>Send values of devices to the log.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devices: List of devices</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Log 'ypos', 'readback'</code>
will send the current value of the "ypos" and "readback"
devices to the log.
</p>
<p>All devices listed in the same log command will be logged with the same "serial number" identifier
to make it obvious that they were taken at the same time, even though their underlying time stamps
obtained from the control system may differ because a value could for example have changed some time ago
and was not modified since.
</p>


<h3><a name="LogConfig"><img alt="log" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/configcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Log Mode Configuration</a></h3>
<p>This command can change the log mode.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log automatically: yes or no</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Log Mode: automatically</code>
changes the default, on-demand mode of logging to the automatic log mode.
</p>
<p>In the default, on-demand log mode, you can log the current value
of devices as desired by adding <a href="#LogCommand">Log Commands</a> to the scan.
You control exactly which device is logged and when.
Below is an example scan and the resulting log.
Note that there is one line of data for each iteration of the nested loop.
</p>

<img alt="on-demand logging" src="log_demand.png" width="412" height="322"/>

<p>When enabling the automatic log mode,
commands that modify the values of devices will automatically
log the value. For example, the <a href="#SetCommand">Set</a>
and <a href="#LoopCommand">Loop</a> Commands will write
the value of their associated device after they set and optionally
waited for them to reach the desired value.
In automatic logging mode, you only need to add specific <a href="#LogCommand">Log</a> commands
to your scan if you want to log additional devices which are not directly
modified by the scan, for example temperature sensors or other read-back values.
</p>

<p>The automatic log mode may appear more convenient than the
on-demand mode, but consider the following example scan and
the resulting data as viewed in a table:
</p>

<img alt="automatic logging" src="log_auto.png" width="440" height="334"/>

<p>When the outer loop sets the "xpos" to 1, that is logged automatically,
but at that time we have not, yet logged a value for anything else, so
the initial table line in the data log only shows "xpos".
When a few milliseconds the inner loop sets the "ypos" to 1, that is also logged,
and now the data log shows the previous value for "xpos" with the "ypos", but
no "readback", yet.
About a second later, the "readback" is logged specifically, and finally
we see all of "xpos", "ypos" and "readback" in the log.
</p>

<p>Similarly, consider the log around 10:51:20.02.
At this time, the outer loop advances "xpos" to 2 and then the inner loop
reserts "ypos" to 1. These events happen at virtually the same time,
but since the two loops log them automatically with their exact time stamp,
they appear as two different events in the log table.
</p>

<p>In summary, the default, on-demand log mode is usually most straight-forward to use.
It results in a compact data log that contains exactly what you want to see,
for example one line of data within the inner loop of a nested scan.
The automatic loop can provide more detail because it logs each change
right away when a set or loop command modifies a device.
</p>


<h3><a name="ScriptCommand"><img alt="script" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/scriptcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Script Command</a></h3>
<p>This command can execute Jython script code inside the scan server.
The script code can read the scan log and the devices used by the scan.
It can also write to devices, and add data to the scan log.
A typical use would be simple data fitting or alignment:
Analyze the log data that the scan has accumulated,
perform a fit, add the fit data to the log for later review,
and position devices to for example a 'peak' located in the fit.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Script: Jython class name</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Script 'MyScriptClass'</code>
will use the <code>MyScriptClass</code> class.
</p>
<p>The script that defines the class <code>MyScriptClass</code> must
be in a file named <code>myscriptclass.py</code>,
i.e. using lower case version of the class name.
The scan server searches for scripts in a list of directories
that is configured via its plugin customization file.
</p>
<p>All script classes must derive from
<a href="java/org/csstudio/scan/command/ScanScript.html">the ScanScript class</a>,
refer to its Javadoc for details.
</p>
<p>Example:
<pre>
# ScriptCommand class that fits a gaussian shape to pos and signal,
# then moves pos to the center of the fit

from org.csstudio.scan.command import ScanScript
from numjy import *

class MyScript(ScanScript):
     def getDeviceNames(self):
       """Return Device (alias) names used by the script
       
          Scan scripts that intend to access devices
          need to list their names.
          This allows the scan system to connect to the
          required devices before starting the scan.

          The default implementation returns an
          empty list, meaning that the script cannot
          access any 'live' devices.
          Only data that the scan has logged by the time
          when the script is invoked will be available.
       """
       return [ "pos", "signal" ]

    def run(self, context):
        """Invoked by the scan server to execute the script.
           Context parameter allows access to logged data, devices, ...
        """
      
        # Turn raw python array into ndarray for easier math
        data = array(context.getData("pos", "signal"))
        x = data[0]
        y = data[1]
        
        # Determine centroid
        center = sum(x * y) / sum(y)
        print "Center: ", center
        
        # Other parameters...
        m = max(y)
        print "Max: ", m
        
        width = sqrt( abs(sum((center-x)**2*y)/sum(y)) )
        print "Width: ", width
        
        # Compute fit
        fit = m*exp(-(x-center)**2/(2*width**2))
        print fit
        
        # Log the 'fit' data for later comparison with raw data
        context.logData("fit", fit.nda)
        
        # Set PVs with result
        context.write("pos", center)
</pre>
</p>

<p>While the script command can be very powerful, it can also be dangerous
because errors in the script are beyond the control of the scan server.
A script can not be paused like other scan commands, but scans with script
commands can still be aborted.
To debug a command script, <code>print</code> statements in the script
can be viewed on the scan server console.
</p>
<p>The use of script commands should be limited to well-tested
and reusable scripts.
Rapidly changing scripts can be executed on the client side.
They can submit scans to the server, fetch the result, perform
computations, submit follow-up scans and so on.
</p>


<h3><a name="DelayCommand"><img alt="delay" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan/icons/delaycommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Delay Command</a></h3>
<p>This command simply delays the scan for a configurable
number of seconds.
</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delay: Seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Delay 1.0 sec</code>
will delay the scan for 1 second.
</p>
<p>Note that you should <u>avoid using the delay command</u>.
It is usually a bad idea to simply wait for a fixed amount of time,
hoping that the experiment reached a desired state,
for example a certain temperature or a certain amount
of beam exposure.
</p>
<p>
If the temperature is already at the desired value before
the delay expires, you have wasted time.
If the beam should turn off, a simply delay will not notice this.
</p>
<p>Instead of a delay, try to use the "Wait" command to wait
for the desired state, for example for a readback to indicate the
desired temperature, or for a beam current measurement device to
indicate a certain amount of beam exposure.
</p>



<h2><a name="editor">Scan Editor</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Editor is a graphical editor for scan configurations.
It shows the hierarchical structure of loops in a scan.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Editor" src="scan_edit.png" width="100%"/>

<p>Basic Operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open new editor from menu <code>CSS/Scan/Scan Editor</code>, or open
    existing <code>*.scn</code> scan file
</li>
<li>Open respectively reset the Scan Editor perspective via
    the context menu.
</li>
<li>Drag new commands from the Scan Command Palette into the "tree"-type
    display of the scan.
</li>
<li>Re-arrange commands by dragging them to a new position within the scan tree.
    Holding the 'Alt' or 'Ctr' key (depending on the operating system)
    while doing this will copy a command.
</li>
<li>Configure the properties of a command in the Properties view.
</li>
<li>Save the scan as a file for later re-use as a <code>*.scn</code> file
    via the menu <code>File/Save</code>.
</li>
<li>Submit to scan server for execution via either the context menu
or the toolbar button <img alt="Run" src="../icons/run.png"/>.
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="macros">Macros</a></h2> 

<p>Device names as for example used in the
<a href="#SetCommand">Set</a>
or
<a href="#LoopCommand">Loop</a>
commands can use macros.
</p>

<p>Instead of specifying a complete device name like
"motor_x", macro expressions like "$(device)" or "motor_$(axis)"
may be used, which would evaluate to the same "motor_x" if
the macros were defined as follows:
<code>device=motor_x, axis=x</code>
</p>

<p>Macros can be defined in the scan server preferences.
They can also be provided in the
<a href="#IncludeCommand">IncludeCommand</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="monitor">Scan Monitor</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Monitor displays the current state of the Scan Server.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Monitor" src="scan_monitor.png"/>

<p>Access the scan monitor via the menu <code>CSS/Scan/Scan Monitor</code>
</p>
<p>It lists which scans have been submitted to the server
and their state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished - OK: Scan has been executed until it finished without errors.</li>
<li>Aborted: The scan was aborted by the user.</li>
<li>Running...: This scan is currently being executed. The "%" column displays the
    progress, and the "Command" column shows the currently active command.
</li>
<li>Idle: The scan has been submitted to the scan server and will be executed
    when previously queued scans have been handled.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The context menu and the toolbar buttons can be used to pause or abort the Running scan,
and to remove completed scans from the server, i.e. scans that have either finished or have been aborted.
</p>


<h2><a name="plot">Scan Plot</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Plot can be used to track the progress of a scan.
Data for devices that are "logged" is accessible to the plot.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Plot" src="scan_plot.png"/>

<p>Access the scan plotmonitor via the menu <code>CSS/Scan/Scan Plot</code>
</p>
<p>Selectors in the toolbar of the plot allow selection of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan - Select from which scan on the server to retrieve data.</li>
<li>X Axis - Select the device to display on the X axis.</li>
<li>Value - Select the device to display on the Y axis.</li>
<li>Add trace <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan.ui.plot/icons/add.gif"/> -
    Add another value trace. You can display multiple value traces over the same X axis.
</li>
<li>Remove trace <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.csstudio.scan.ui.plot/icons/delete.gif"/> -
    If you added value traces, you can remove them with this button.
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="scan_data">Scan Data Display</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Data Display can be used to track the progress of a scan
similar to the plot, but it displays the data as a table.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Data Display" src="scan_data.png"/>

<p>Open the data display from the <a href="#monitor">Scan Monitor</a>
by right-clicking on the desired scan and selecting <code>Open Scan Data Display</code>.
</p> 

<p>You can save the displayed data to a file via the menu <code>File/Save As</code>
or via the context menu of the data display table.
</p>

<p>The format of the generated file depends on the file extension:
</p>
<ul>
<li>File name ending in ".csv": A comma-separated file is created.</li>
<li>Other file name endings, for example ".dat": A text file with fixed-sized columns is created.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="errors">Error Handling</a></h2> 

<p>Scan commands can fail:
A <a href="#SetCommand">Set</a>
or <a href="#LoopCommand">Loop Command</a>
may not be able to write to a device,
or there may be a time-out while waiting for the read-back to match
the written value. 
In fact such errors are almost to be expected.
The Scan Server will not quit when one of its commands experiences
an error.
Instead, it will by default abort the affected scan, and continue to
run the next submitted scan.
</p>

<p>In some cases it can be useful to change the default behavior
by specifying a specific error handler:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the command's "Error Handler" property to the name
of the desired error handler, for example "OnErrorContinue".
</li>
<li>The error handler is implemented as a Jython class, derived from
<a href="java/org/csstudio/scan/command/ScanErrorHandler.html">ScanErrorHandler</a>.
The scan server searches for error handlers in the same list of directories that
is configured via its plugin customization file for the 
or <a href="#ScriptCommand">Script Command</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Example error handlers:</p> 

<ol>
<li>ScanErrorHandler that ignores any error
<pre>from org.csstudio.scan.command import ScanErrorHandler

class OnErrorContinue(ScanErrorHandler):
    
    def handleError(self, command, error, context):
        print "Ignoring error from " + str(command)
        return ScanErrorHandler.Result.Continue
</pre>
</li>
<li>ScanErrorHandler that retries several times, then aborts:
<pre>from org.csstudio.scan.command import ScanErrorHandler

class OnErrorRetryThenAbort(ScanErrorHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the number of retries 
        self.retries = 3
    
    def handleError(self, command, error, context):
        self.retries -= 1
        if self.retries > 0:
            print "Retrying " + str(command) + " " + str(self.retries) + " more times ..."
            return ScanErrorHandler.Result.Retry
        else:    
            return ScanErrorHandler.Result.Abort
</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="server">Scan Server</a></h2> 

<p>The scan server is a program that executes submitted scans.
There is typically one scan server instance per beam line.
</p>
<p>When multiple scans are submitted, they are executed in the order
of submission. If a user submits a scan while the
scan server is still executing a scan, this will not impact the
ongoing scan. The new scan is simply queued for execution after
the current scan finishes.
This also allows users to plan ahead, submitting scans for several experiment
runs in advance, and the scan server will then execute them one after the other.
</p>
<p>Users do not directly interact with the scan server.
They use the <a href="#editor">Scan Editor</a> 
or beamline-specific user interface panels to submit scans.
Users can monitor the progress via directly monitoring the
temperature, sample position or other experiment properties
affected by the scan, or use the <a href="#monitor">Scan Monitor</a>
to track the progress of a scan and potentially pause or abort it.
</p>

<h3><a name="server_setup">Scan Server Setup</a></h3>

<p>The scan server is maintained by a system administrator,
it should for example run as a Linux service and thus always be available.
End users can submit scans to the scan server, monitor their
progress and also abort scans, but end users will typically not
start or stop the scan server itself.
</p>
<p>End users may have to know the host where the scan server is running
so that they can connect to the scan server from scripts,
or verify their CSS preference settings.
The CSS menu <code>Edit/Preferences/Scan</code> shows
the host name and port number for connecting to the scan server,
and scripts use Java properties <code>ScanServerHost</code>
and <code>ScanServerPort</code> for the respective settings.
</p>
<p>The scan server itself if configured via a plugin customization file,
review the one included in the server for an example.
</p>


<h3><a name="server_log">Log Access</a></h3>

<p>The scan server maintains the log.
By default this is stored in a relational database (Derby).
The storage location of the database as well as
optional network access via JDBC or Derby tools
is configured in the server's plugin customization file.
</p>

<p>The preferred way of accessing the log is via the network API
of the scan server.
For maintenance, see Readme.txt in the plugin <code>org.csstudio.scan.log.derby</code>.
</p>


<h3><a name="server_network">Network Details</a></h3>

<p>The network communication between the scan server and clients like CSS
is based on a RESTful web interface.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The port number is configured via the Java system property
    <code>ScanServerPort</code>.
    For the CSS client GUI, this can be set via an Eclipse preference
    which then (on CSS startup) sets the system property.
    If not configured, the default port is 4810.
</li>
<li>The scan server runs on the host where it is started.
    By default, clients will search for a scan server on the local host.
    To connect to a scan server on a designated host,
    configure the Java system property
    <code>ScanServerHost</code> or, for the CSS GUI, the associated
    Eclipse preference.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Documentation for the REST web interface is available by
pointing a web browser to the web URL of the scan server,
for example
<a href="http://localhost:4810/index.html">http://localhost:4810/index.html</a>.
</p>

<p>The scan server can also update PVs with basic status information.
The base name of these PVs is configured via the scan server preferences.
The PVs must be made available by an IOC on the network, for example using
the <code>examples/scan.db</code>.
The scan server will update the following PVs:
</p>

<ol>
<li>{prefix}Active - Set to 1 when the scan server is actively executing a scan, else 0.
</li>
<li>{prefix}Status - Set to the name of the active scan.
</li>
<li>{prefix}Progress - Set to 0...100 to indicate progress of active scan.
</li>
<li>{prefix}Finish - Updated to the (estimated) finish time of the active scan.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Firewalls</h4>

<p>To allow access to a scan server through firewalls, the TCP port
described in the previous section needs to be opened for access by clients.
The default is 4810.
</p>


<h2><a name="programmatic">Programmatic Access</a></h2>

<p>A key feature of the scan system is that scans can be submitted
from various sources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated <a href="#editor">Scan editor</a>.
</li>
<li>CSS 'BOY' operator interface panels.
</li>
<li>Jython script, i.e. using the Python language,
    either edited, executed and debugged from within CSS,
    or from the command line.
</li>
<li>Any Java tool, including applications that interface to Java like Matlab.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This provides a lot of options to programmers.
At the same time, the details can be hidden behind
for example a 'BOY' operator interface panel,
so even users with no programming experience can
then configure and execute scans for common beamline
tasks that have prepared interface panels.
</p>

<p>For details refer to the examples
and the
