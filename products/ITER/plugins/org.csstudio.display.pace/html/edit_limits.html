<h1>Editing Values</h1>
Edit values by clicking into the cell, entering a new value, then
pressing <b>Return</b>. The background of edited cells changes to
indicate that they differ from the original value of the PV.
<p>
Note that <u>changes are not written out to PVs, yet</u>,
until the changes are <a href=save_limits.html>saved.</a>
<p>

Cells in columns which have a gray background and a
<a href=tooltips.html>Tooltip</a>
that indicates <b>read-only</b> can not be edited.
See <a href=config.html>Configuration Files</a>.

<h2>Change Multiple Limits To The Same Value</h2>
To set multiple cells in a row to the same value,
select the desired rows, then right-click on 
one cell in the desired column and invoke <b>Set Value</b>
from the context menu.
<p>
In the example below, the rows for "MEBT 1" to "CCL 4"
were selected, then the right button context menu
was invoked on one of the selected cells in the
"PwrLmtAdm" column. After entering a value and pressing <b>OK</b>,
the "PwrLmtAdm" cells for rows "MEBT 1" to "CCL 4"
will be set to the entered value.

<h2>Change All Limits In A Column To The Same Value</h2>
To set all the cells in a column to the same value,
left-click the mouse on the desired column header.
<p>
Below, the "PwrLmtAdm" column was selected. This will
obviously only be possible for editable columns,
not for read-only columns, indicated by a grey
background.

Pressing the <b>OK</b> results in the screen below.
Note how all but the "RFQ" entry which was already
set to a value of 1000 are highlighted to indicate
the changed value, and the asterisk next to the window
title (*rf_admin.pace) also reflects that some values
have been changed.

<h2>Revert Changes</h2>
To set selected edited cells back to their original value,
select the desired rows, then right-click on 
one cell in the desired column and invoke <b>Restore Original Value</b>
from the context menu.
