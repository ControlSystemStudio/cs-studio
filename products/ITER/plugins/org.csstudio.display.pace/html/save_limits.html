<h1>Saving Changes</h1>
After <a href=edit_limits.html>editing some values</a>,
the changes can be written to the underlying process variables
by selecting <b>File/Save</b> from the menu bar.
Alternatively, the toolbar icon <img src="save.png" width=15 height=15>
or a keyboard shortcut like <b>Ctrl-S</b> may be available.
<p> 
When closing a PACE table with modified values, you will also
be asked if you want to save the changes or close without saving.
<p>
Before actually writing the changes to the PVs, a dialog as shown
below will prompt for information to be entered into the ELog.

<ul>
<li>Enter your ELog user name and password.
<li>You can edit the title and text, which starts out as a list
    of modified PVs and their values
<li>Press <b>OK</b> to perform the ELog entry and PV update.
<li>.. or press <b>Cancel</b>.
</ul>

<h2>Save not available</h2>
The option to save changes is only available when there are any
modified values.
This is also indicated via an asterix in the PACE table title.
If no values where modified from the PVs' original values,
there is nothing to save and the option to do so is
not available.
