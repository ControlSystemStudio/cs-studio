/** Implementation of a command
 *
 *  <p>Wraps a {@link ScanCommand} and allows execution of the command.
 *
 *  <p>Most commands will perform one unit of work,
 *  for example set a PV.
 *  A loop on the other hand will perform one unit of work per loop
 *  iteration.
 *
 *  <p>The {@link ExecutableScan} queries each command for the number of work
 *  units that it will perform, and the command must then update
 *  the {@link ScanContext} with the number of performed work
 *  units.
 *
 *  <p>Work units are just a guess to provide a progress indication.
 *  If a command cannot estimate the number of work units
 *  because it will dynamically perform more or less work,
 *  it should return 1.
 *  Likewise, a delay of 1 second or 1 minute would each be one
 *  work unit, even though their duration differs a lot.
