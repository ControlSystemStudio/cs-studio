<h1>Scan System</h1>

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2> 

<p>The scan system is used to automate experiments.
For example, it can move a motor from some start
position to an end position in certain steps,
waiting at each step until experiment data has been taken.
</p>

<p>A scan can consist of several nested loops.
For example, at each step of moving the "horizontal"
position of a sample, an inner loop can vary the
"vertical" position of the sample to perform a
2-dimensional scan of the sample surface.
As another example, an outer loop may vary the sample
temperature while inner loops vary the sample position.
</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the scan system
uses separate tools to define a scan, to execute a scan
and to monitor it:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Scans are configured via a control system panel,
a scan editor, or a script.
</li>
<li>The commands of a scan are then submitted
to a Scan Server for execution.
</li>
<li>You can monitor the execution of a scan in various ways.
</li>
</ol>

<p>This design allows scans to execute even if the
original control system panel has been closed.
Scans can be monitored, paused or aborted 
independent from the computer that submitted the scans.
</p>


<h2><a name="commands">Commands</a></h2> 

<img alt="Example Scan" src="scan_example.png"/>

<p>The picture above shows a scan with two nested loops
as it would appear in the <a href="#editor">Scan Editor</a>.
What follows is a description of all available commands.
</p>


<h3><img alt="set" src="../../org.csstudio.scan/icons/setcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Set Command</h3>
<p>This command sets a device to a desired value.
</p>
<p>In addition to sending the desired value to the device,
it can also wait for the device or an associated read-back device
to actually reach the desired value.
</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Name of the device to set.</li>
<li>Value: Desired value of the device.</li>
<li>Wait for readback: By default, the command will wait until the device reaches the commanded value.</li>
<li>Readback Device: By default, the Device where the value was written is also checked for reaching the commanded value.
    Optionally, a different "read back" device can be used.</li>
<li>Tolerance: Difference between the actual value of the device and the desired value
    that is considered "good enough".</li>
<li>Timeout: Time in seconds that the command will wait for the device (or separate read back) to reach
    the commanded value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
<code>Set 'setpoint' = 1.0</code>
will write the value 1.0 to the "setpoint" device.
</p>
<p>
<code>Set 'setpoint' = 1.0 (wait for 'readback' +-0.1, 10.0 sec timeout)</code>
will also write the value 1.0 to the "setpoint" device.
In addition to the previous example the command will wait up to 10 seconds
for the "readback" device to reach the value of 1.0 with a tolerance of 0.1,
that is a value within 0.9 and 1.0.
</p>


<h3><img alt="wait" src="../../org.csstudio.scan/icons/waitcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Wait Command</h3>
<p>This command waits for a device to reach a desired value.
</p>
<p>The Set command described above already contains similar functionality,
but it can only wait for a device to reach the absolute value to which it
has been commanded.
The separate wait command can be used to wait for a <i>different</i>
value, or to wait for a device to increase or decrease by a certain value.
</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Name of the device to set.</li>
<li>Comparison: How the current value of the device is compared to the desired value.
    Options include equal, less than etc. as well as "increase by" or "decrease by"
    for comparisons relative to the original value of the device at the time when
    the command is becoming active.</li>
<li>Desired Value: Desired value of the device.</li>
<li>Tolerance: Difference between the actual value of the device and the desired value
    that is considered "good enough".</li>
<li>Timeout: Time in seconds that the command will wait for the device to reach
    the desired value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<p>
<code>Wait for 'readback' = 1.0 (+-0.1)</code>
will wait until the value of the "readback" device reaches the value 1.0+-0.1,
i.e. is within the range of 0.9 ... 1.1.
Because of rounding errors and control system noise you should never
set the tolerance to 0.0 for the equality ('=') check,
because your device might never reach the exact desired value.
Configure a small tolerance like 0.001 to allow for rounding errors.
</p>
<p>
<code>Wait for 'readback' > 5.0</code>
will wait until the value of the "readback" device
is above 5.0.
</p>
<p>
<code>Wait for 'readback' to increase by 5.0</code>
will wait until the value of the "readback" device
increases by 5.0.
Assuming that the value was 10.0 when we reached this
wait command, the value would have to grow to at least
15.0 for the wait command to finish.
</p>


<h3><img alt="loop" src="../../org.csstudio.scan/icons/loopcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Loop Command</h3>
<p>This command changes a device from a start to an end value.
It is at the core of most scans.
</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device: Name of the device to set.</li>
<li>Initial Value: Initial value of the device.</li>
<li>Final Value: Final value of the device.</li>
<li>Step Size: Step in which value of device should be changed.</li>
<li>Wait for readback: By default, the loop will wait until the device reaches the commanded value.</li>
<li>Readback Device: By default, the loop device to which the loop writes is also checked for reaching the commanded value.
    Optionally, a different "read back" device can be used.</li>
<li>Tolerance: Difference between the actual value of the device and the desired value
    that is considered "good enough".</li>
<li>Timeout: Time in seconds that the command will wait for the device (or separate read back) to reach
    the commanded value.</li>
<li>Body: Commands to be executed at each step of the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Loop 'xpos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code>
will set the "xpos" device to 0.0, then 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0.
At each step it will execute the "body" of the loop.
</p>
<p>Loops can count "up" as well as "down".
A loop from 0 to 5 in steps of 1 will operate as just mentioned.
A loop from 5 to 0 in steps of -1 will assume values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
When specifying a step direction that does <u>not</u> match
the loop direction, for example a loop from 0 to 5 in steps of -1,
the loop will have a special behavior:
It will toggle its direction each time it is executed.
This can be useful for nested loops that are intended to scan a surface,
as shown in the diagram below:
</p>

<img alt="Example for alternate scan" src="scan_alternate.png" width="90%"/>

<p>The normal scan displayed in the left diagram was executed with nested loops</p>
<p>
<code>Loop 'xpos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Loop 'ypos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code>
</p>

<p>The alternating scan displayed to the right was executed with nested loops</p>
<p>
<code>Loop 'xpos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step 1.0</code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Loop 'ypos' = 0.0 ... 5.0, step -1.0</code>
</p>
<p>causing the inner loop on "ypos" to alternate direction each time is is executed.
If these "xpos" and "ypos" devices are for example connected to stepper motors,
the alternating scan will be faster and reduce wear on the motors.
</p>


<h3><img alt="log" src="../../org.csstudio.scan/icons/logcommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Log Command</h3>
<p>Send values of devices to the log.
</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devices: List of devices</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Log 'ypos', 'readback'</code>
will send the current value of the "ypos" and "readback"
devices to the log.
</p>
<p>Note that Loop, Set and Wait commands will automatically
log the value of the device which they <u>read</u>.
By default, this is the device to which the Loop and Set command
write, unless a separate read-back device is specified. 
</p>


<h3><img alt="delay" src="../../org.csstudio.scan/icons/delaycommand.gif"/>&nbsp;Delay Command</h3>
<p>This command simply delays the scan for a configurable
number of seconds.
</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delay: Seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
<code>Delay 1.0 sec</code>
will delay the scan for 1 second.
</p>
<p>Note that you should <u>avoid using the delay command</u>.
It is usually a bad idea to simply wait for a fixed amount of time,
hoping that the experiment reached a desired state,
for example a certain temperature or a certain amount
of beam exposure.
</p>
<p>
If the temperature is already at the desired value before
the delay expires, you have wasted time.
If the beam should turn off, a simply delay will not notice this.
</p>
<p>Instead of a delay, try to use the "Wait" command to wait
for the desired state, for example for a readback to indicate the
desired temperature, or for a beam current measurement device to
indicate a certain amount of beam exposure.
</p>



<h2><a name="server">Scan Server</a></h2> 

<p>The scan server is a program that executes submitted scans.
There is typically one scan server instance per beam line.
</p>
<p>When multiple scans are submitted, they are executed in the order
of submission. If a user submits a scan while the
scan server is still executing a scan, this will not impact the
ongoing scan. The new scan is simply queued for execution after
the current scan finishes.
This also allows users to plan ahead, submitting scans for several experiment
runs in advance, and the scan server will then execute them one after the other.
</p>
<p>Users do not directly interact with the scan server.
They use the <a href="#editor">Scan Editor</a> 
or beamline-specific user interface panels to submit scans.
Users can monitor the progress via directly monitoring the
temperature, sample position or other experiment properties
affected by the scan, or use the <a href="#monitor">Scan Monitor</a>
to track the progress of a scan and potentially pause or abort it.
</p>

<h3>Scan Server Setup</h3>

<p>The scan server is maintained by a system administrator,
it should for example run as a Linux service and thus always be available.
End users can submit scans to the scan server, monitor their
progress and also abort scans, but end users will typically not
start or stop the scan server itself.
</p>
<p>End users may have to know the host where the scan server is running
so that they can connect to the scan server from scripts,
or verify their CSS preference settings.
The CSS menu <code>Edit/Preferences/Scan</code> shows
the host name and port number for connecting to the scan server,
and scripts use Java properties <code>ScanServerHost</code>
and <code>ScanServerPort</code> for the respective settings.
</p>
<p>The scan server itself if configured via a plugin customization file,
review the one included in the server for an example.
</p>


<h3>Network Details</h3>

<p>The network communication between the scan server and clients like CSS
is based on Java RMI and currently uses two TCP network ports:</p>
<ol>
<li>The port number configured via the <code>ScanServerPort</code>
    or associated Eclipse preference is used by the RMI <u>Registry</u>.
    Clients connect to this registry to locate the scan server
    interface.
</li>
<li>The next port number, i.e. <code>ScanServerPort+1</code>,
    is where the actual scan server binding is exported to clients.
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Firewalls</h3>

<p>To allow access to a scan server through firewalls, both TCP ports
described in the previous section need to be opened for access by clients.
Their defaults are 4810 and 4811.
</p>


<h3>Multi-Network Installation</h3>

<p>The scan server can be executed on a host with multiple network
interfaces, for example a host with a public network interface
like 160.0.0.1 as well as a private network interface like 10.0.0.1.
This does, however, require additional configuration.
</p>

<p>The scan server will by default listen to connections on all available network interfaces,
for example on the default TCP ports 4810 and 4811.
But when a client connects to the registry on say 10.0.0.1:4810,
i.e. the private network interface, the registry may return
the address 160.0.0.1:4811, i.e. the public address of the scan server
binding, or vice versa: A client connecting to the RMI registry on the public network
may receive the private network address of the scan server binding.
</p>

<p>One solution to this problem is to start the scan server with a Java property
<code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> set like this that forces it to return a
specific host name for all client connections:
</p>

<pre>
ScanServer -pluginCustomization .... -vmargs -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=scan_server_host
</pre>

<p>The RMI Registry will now always instruct clients to use <code>scan_server_host:4811</code>
to connect to the scan server binding.
Clients on the public network need to define this host name to match the public network address
of the host (scan_server_host = 160.0.0.1),
while clients on the private network need to define the same name to match
the private network address of the host (scan_server_host = 10.0.0.1).
On a Linux computer, this can be done via the file <code>/etc/hosts</code>.
</p>


<h2><a name="editor">Scan Editor</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Editor is a graphical editor for scan configurations.
It shows the hierarchical structure of loops in a scan.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Editor" src="scan_edit.png" width="100%"/>

<p>Basic Operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open new editor from menu <code>CSS/Scan/Scan Editor</code>, or open
    existing <code>*.scn</code> scan file
</li>
<li>Open respectively reset the Scan Editor perspective via
    the context menu.
</li>
<li>Drag new commands from the Scan Command Palette into the "tree"-type
    display of the scan.
</li>
<li>Re-arrange commands by dragging them to a new position within the scan tree.
    Holding the 'Alt' or 'Ctr' key (depending on the operating system)
    while doing this will copy a command.
</li>
<li>Configure the properties of a command in the Properties view.
</li>
<li>Save the scan as a file for later re-use as a <code>*.scn</code> file
    via the menu <code>File/Save</code>.
</li>
<li>Submit to scan server for execution via either the context menu
or the toolbar button <img alt="Run" src="../icons/run.png"/>.
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="monitor">Scan Monitor</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Monitor displays the current state of the Scan Server.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Monitor" src="scan_monitor.png" width="80%"/>

<p>Access the scan monitor via the menu <code>CSS/Scan/Scan Monitor</code>
</p>
<p>It lists which scans have been submitted to the server
and their state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished - OK: Scan has been executed until it finished without errors.</li>
<li>Aborted: The scan was aborted by the user.</li>
<li>Running...: This scan is currently being executed. The "%" column displays the
    progress, and the "Command" column shows the currently active command.
</li>
<li>Idle: The scan has been submitted to the scan server and will be executed
    when previously queued scans have been handled.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The context menu and the toolbar buttons can be used to pause or abort the Running scan,
and to remove completed scans from the server, i.e. scans that have either finished or have been aborted.
</p>


<h2><a name="plot">Scan Plot</a></h2> 
<p>The Scan Plot can be used to track the progress of a scan.
Data for devices that are "logged" is accessible to the plot.
</p>

<img alt="Scan Plot" src="scan_plot.png" width="80%"/>

<p>Access the scan plotmonitor via the menu <code>CSS/Scan/Scan Plot</code>
</p>
<p>Selectors in the toolbar of the plot allow selection of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan: Select from which scan on the server to retrieve data.</li>
<li>X Axis: Select the device to display on the X axis.</li>
<li>Y Axis: Select the device to display on the X axis.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="programmatic">Programmatic Access</a></h2>
<p>A key feature of the scan system is that scans can be submitted
from various sources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jython script, i.e. using the Python language,
    either edited, executed and debugged from within CSS
    or from the command line
</li>
<li>CSS 'BOY' operator interface panels.
</li>
<li>Any Java tool.
</li>
<li>Applications that interface to Java like Matlab.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This provides a lot of options to programmers.
At the same time, the details can be hidden behind
for example a 'BOY' operator interface panel,
so even users with no programming experience can
then configure and execute these scans.
</p>

<p>For now refer to <code>org.csstudio.scan/examples</code>
for details.
