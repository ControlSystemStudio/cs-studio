    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>Hibernate, like all other object/relational mapping tools, requires
    metadata that governs the transformation of data from one representation
    to the other. Hibernate Annotations provides annotation-based mapping metadata.
    </para>

    <para>The JPA specification recognizes the interest and the success of
    the transparent object/relational mapping paradigm. It standardizes the
    basic APIs and the metadata needed for any object/relational persistence
    mechanism.
    <emphasis>Hibernate EntityManager</emphasis> implements the
    programming interfaces and lifecycle rules as defined by the JPA
    persistence specification and together with <emphasis>Hibernate
    Annotations</emphasis> offers a complete (and standalone) JPA persistence
    solution on top of the mature Hibernate Core. You may use a combination of
    all three together, annotations without JPA programming interfaces and
    lifecycle, or even pure native Hibernate Core, depending on the business and
    technical needs of your project. At all time you can fall back to
    Hibernate native APIs, or if required, even to native JDBC and SQL.</para>

    <para>This release of <emphasis>Hibernate Annotations</emphasis> is based
    on the final release of the JPA 2 specification (aka <ulink
    url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317">JSR-317</ulink>) and
    supports all its features (including the optional ones). Hibernate
    specific features and extensions are also available through
    unstandardized, Hibernate specific annotations.</para>

    <para>If you are moving from previous Hibernate Annotations versions,
    please have a look at <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org/398.html">Java
    Persistence migration guide</ulink>.</para>
