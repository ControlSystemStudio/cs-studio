msgid "Hibernate3 has the ability to pre-define filter criteria and attach those filters at both a class level and a collection level. A filter criteria allows you to define a restriction clause similar to the existing \"where\" attribute available on the class and various collection elements. These filter conditions, however, can be parameterized. The application can then decide at runtime whether certain filters should be enabled and what their parameter values should be. Filters can be used like database views, but they are parameterized inside the application."

By default, filters are <emphasis>not</emphasis> enabled for a given session. Filters must be enabled through use of the <literal>Session.enableFilter()</literal> method, which returns an instance of the <literal>Filter</literal> interface.
