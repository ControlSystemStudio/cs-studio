    <title>Working with objects</title>

    <para>
        Hibernate is a full object/relational mapping solution that not only shields
        the developer from the details of the underlying database management
        system, but also offers <emphasis>state management</emphasis> of objects. This is,
        contrary to the management of SQL <literal>statements</literal> in common JDBC/SQL
        persistence layers, a natural object-oriented view of persistence in Java
        applications.
    </para>

    <para>
        In other words, Hibernate application developers should always think about the
        <emphasis>state</emphasis> of their objects, and not necessarily about the
        execution of SQL statements. This part is taken care of by Hibernate and is only
        relevant for the application developer when tuning the performance of the system.

    <section id="objectstate-overview">
        <title>Hibernate object states</title>

        <para>
            Hibernate defines and supports the following object states:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>Transient</emphasis> - an object is transient if it has just
                    been instantiated using the <literal>new</literal> operator, and it
                    is not associated with a Hibernate <literal>Session</literal>. It has no
                    persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been
                    assigned. Transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if
                    the application does not hold a reference anymore. Use the Hibernate
                    <literal>Session</literal> to make an object persistent (and let Hibernate
                    take care of the SQL statements that need to be executed for this transition).
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>Persistent</emphasis> - a persistent instance has a representation
                    in the database and an identifier value. It might just have been saved or loaded,
                    however, it is by definition in the scope of a <literal>Session</literal>.
                    Hibernate will detect any changes made to an object in persistent state and
                    synchronize the state with the database when the unit of work completes.
                    Developers do not execute manual <literal>UPDATE</literal> statements, or
                    <literal>DELETE</literal> statements when an object should be made transient.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>Detached</emphasis> - a detached instance is an object that has been
                    persistent, but its <literal>Session</literal> has been closed. The reference
                    to the object is still valid, of course, and the detached instance might even
                    be modified in this state. A detached instance can be reattached to a new
                    <literal>Session</literal> at a later point in time, making it (and all the
                    modifications) persistent again. This feature enables a programming model for
                    long running units of work that require user think-time. We call them
                    <emphasis>application transactions</emphasis>, i.e., a unit of work from the
                    point of view of the user.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
            We will now discuss the states and state transitions (and the Hibernate methods that
            trigger a transition) in more detail.

        <title>Making objects persistent</title>

        <para>
            Newly instantiated instances of a persistent class are considered 
            <emphasis>transient</emphasis> by Hibernate. We can make a transient 
            instance <emphasis>persistent</emphasis> by associating it with a 
            session:
        </para>

        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[DomesticCat fritz = new DomesticCat();
fritz.setColor(Color.GINGER);
fritz.setSex('M');
fritz.setName("Fritz");
Long generatedId = (Long) sess.save(fritz);]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If <literal>Cat</literal> has a generated identifier, the identifier is
            generated and assigned to the <literal>cat</literal> when <literal>save()</literal> 
            is called. If <literal>Cat</literal> has an <literal>assigned</literal>
            identifier, or a composite key, the identifier should be assigned to 
            the <literal>cat</literal> instance before calling <literal>save()</literal>.
            You can also use <literal>persist()</literal> instead of <literal>save()</literal>,
            with the semantics defined in the EJB3 early draft.
        </para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <literal>persist()</literal> makes a transient instance persistent. 
                    However, it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to 
                    the persistent instance immediately, the assignment might happen at flush time. 
                    <literal>persist()</literal> also guarantees that it will not execute an 
                    <literal>INSERT</literal> statement if it is called outside of transaction 
                    boundaries. This is useful in long-running conversations with an extended 
                    Session/persistence context.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <literal>save()</literal> does guarantee to return an identifier. If an INSERT 
                    has to be executed to get the identifier ( e.g. "identity" generator, not 
                    "sequence"), this INSERT happens immediately, no matter if you are inside or 
                    outside of a transaction. This is problematic in a long-running conversation  
                    with an extended Session/persistence context.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>        

        <para>
            Alternatively, you can assign the identifier using an overloaded version
            of <literal>save()</literal>.
        </para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[DomesticCat pk = new DomesticCat();
pk.setColor(Color.TABBY);
pk.setSex('F');
pk.setName("PK");
pk.setKittens( new HashSet() );
pk.addKitten(fritz);
sess.save( pk, new Long(1234) );]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            If the object you make persistent has associated objects (e.g. the
            <literal>kittens</literal> collection in the previous example),
            these objects can be made persistent in any order you like unless you
            have a <literal>NOT NULL</literal> constraint upon a foreign key column.
            There is never a risk of violating foreign key constraints. However, you 
            might violate a <literal>NOT NULL</literal> constraint if you
            <literal>save()</literal> the objects in the wrong order.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Usually you do not bother with this detail, as you will normally use Hibernate's
            <emphasis>transitive persistence</emphasis> feature to save the associated
            objects automatically. Then, even <literal>NOT NULL</literal>
            constraint violations do not occur - Hibernate will take care of everything.
            Transitive persistence is discussed later in this chapter.
        </para>

    <section id="objectstate-loading">
        <title>Loading an object</title>

        <para>
            The <literal>load()</literal> methods of <literal>Session</literal> provide
            a way of retrieving a persistent instance if you know its identifier. 
            <literal>load()</literal> takes a class object and loads the state into 
            a newly instantiated instance of that class in a persistent state.
        </para>

        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[Cat fritz = (Cat) sess.load(Cat.class, generatedId);]]></programlisting>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[// you need to wrap primitive identifiers
long id = 1234;
DomesticCat pk = (DomesticCat) sess.load( DomesticCat.class, new Long(id) );]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Alternatively, you can load state into a given instance:
        </para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[Cat cat = new DomesticCat();
// load pk's state into cat
sess.load( cat, new Long(pkId) );
Set kittens = cat.getKittens();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Be aware that <literal>load()</literal> will throw an unrecoverable exception if 
            there is no matching database row. If the class is mapped with a proxy, 
            <literal>load()</literal> just returns an uninitialized proxy and does not 
            actually hit the database until you invoke a method of the proxy. This 
            is useful if you wish to create an association to an object
            without actually loading it from the database. It also allows multiple
            instances to be loaded as a batch if <literal>batch-size</literal> is
            defined for the class mapping.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If you are not certain that a matching row exists, you should use the 
            <literal>get()</literal> method which hits the database immediately and 
            returns null if there is no matching row.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[Cat cat = (Cat) sess.get(Cat.class, id);
if (cat==null) {
    cat = new Cat();
    sess.save(cat, id);
}
return cat;]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            You can even load an object using an SQL <literal>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</literal>,
            using a <literal>LockMode</literal>. See the API documentation for more information.
        </para>

        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[Cat cat = (Cat) sess.get(Cat.class, id, LockMode.UPGRADE);]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Any associated instances or contained collections will 
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> be selected <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal>, unless you decide
            to specify <literal>lock</literal> or <literal>all</literal> as a
            cascade style for the association.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            It is possible to re-load an object and all its collections at any time, using the 
            <literal>refresh()</literal> method. This is useful when database triggers are used to
            initialize some of the properties of the object.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[sess.save(cat);
sess.flush(); //force the SQL INSERT
sess.refresh(cat); //re-read the state (after the trigger executes)]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            How much does Hibernate load
            from the database and how many SQL <literal>SELECT</literal>s will it use? This
            depends on the <emphasis>fetching strategy</emphasis>. This is explained in
            <xref linkend="performance-fetching"/>.
        </para>

    <section id="objectstate-querying" revision="1">
        <title>Querying</title>

        <para>
            If you do not know the identifiers of the objects you are looking for, 
            you need a query. Hibernate supports an easy-to-use but powerful object 
            oriented query language (HQL). For programmatic query creation, Hibernate
            supports a sophisticated Criteria and Example query feature (QBC and QBE).
            You can also express your query in the native SQL of your database, with
            optional support from Hibernate for result set conversion into objects.
        </para>

        <section id="objectstate-querying-executing" revision="1">
            <title>Executing queries</title>

            <para>
                HQL and native SQL queries are represented with an instance of <literal>org.hibernate.Query</literal>.
                This interface offers methods for parameter binding, result set handling, and for the execution
                of the actual query. You always obtain a <literal>Query</literal> using the current
                <literal>Session</literal>:
            </para>

        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[List cats = session.createQuery(
    "from Cat as cat where cat.birthdate < ?")
    .setDate(0, date)
    .list();

List mothers = session.createQuery(
    "select mother from Cat as cat join cat.mother as mother where cat.name = ?")
    .setString(0, name)
    .list();

List kittens = session.createQuery(
    "from Cat as cat where cat.mother = ?")
    .setEntity(0, pk)

Query mothersWithKittens = (Cat) session.createQuery(
    "select mother from Cat as mother left join fetch mother.kittens");
Set uniqueMothers = new HashSet(mothersWithKittens.list());]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                A query is usually executed by invoking <literal>list()</literal>. The
                result of the query will be loaded completely into a collection in memory.
                Entity instances retrieved by a query are in a persistent state. The
                <literal>uniqueResult()</literal> method offers a shortcut if you
                know your query will only return a single object. Queries that
                make use of eager fetching of collections usually return duplicates of
                the root objects, but with their collections initialized. You can filter
                these duplicates through a <literal>Set</literal>.
            </para>

            <section id="objectstate-querying-executing-iterate">
                <title>Iterating results</title>

                <para>
                    Occasionally, you might be able to achieve better performance by
                    executing the query using the <literal>iterate()</literal> method.
                    This will usually be the case if you expect that the actual
                    entity instances returned by the query will already be in the session
                    or second-level cache. If they are not already cached,
                    <literal>iterate()</literal> will be slower than <literal>list()</literal>
                    and might require many database hits for a simple query, usually
                    <emphasis>1</emphasis> for the initial select which only returns identifiers,
                    and <emphasis>n</emphasis> additional selects to initialize the actual instances.

                A collection <emphasis>filter</emphasis> is a special type of query that can be applied to
                a persistent collection or array. The query string can refer to <literal>this</literal>,

                The returned collection is considered a bag that is a copy of the given

                the implication of the name "filter", but consistent with expected behavior.

            <para>
                Observe that filters do not require a <literal>from</literal> clause, although they can have

            to call a particular method (like <literal>update()</literal>, which has a different
            purpose) to make your modifications persistent. The most straightforward way to update

        <para>
            Sometimes this programming model is inefficient, as it requires in the same session both an SQL
            <literal>SELECT</literal> to load an object and an SQL <literal>UPDATE</literal>

            Hibernate does not offer its own API for direct execution of

            transaction processing-oriented applications. Future versions of Hibernate

            Many applications need to retrieve an object in one transaction, send it to the
            UI layer for manipulation, then save the changes in a new transaction.
            Applications that use this kind of approach in a high-concurrency environment
            usually use versioned data to ensure isolation for the "long" unit of work.
        </para>

        <para>
            Hibernate supports this model by providing for reattachment of detached instances
            using the <literal>Session.update()</literal> or <literal>Session.merge()</literal>
            methods:
        </para>

        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[// in the first session

        <para>
            Use <literal>update()</literal> if you are certain that the session does
            not contain an already persistent instance with the same identifier. Use
            <literal>merge()</literal> if you want to merge your modifications at any time
            without consideration of the state of the session. In other words, <literal>update()</literal>
            is usually the first method you would call in a fresh session, ensuring that
            the reattachment of your detached instances is the first operation that is executed.
        </para>

        <para>
            The application should individually <literal>update()</literal> detached instances

            <literal>saveOrUpdate()</literal>, or <literal>merge()</literal>. Some whole

            It is possible to change the default behavior so that flush occurs less frequently.
            The <literal>FlushMode</literal> class defines three different modes: only flush

            is used, flush automatically using the explained routine, or never flush unless
            <literal>flush()</literal> is called explicitly. The last mode is useful for long running
            units of work, where a <literal>Session</literal> is kept open and disconnected for
            a long time (see <xref linkend="transactions-optimistic-longsession"/>).

    <section id="objectstate-transitive" revision="1">
        <title>Transitive persistence</title>

        <para>
            It is quite cumbersome to save, delete, or reattach individual objects,
            especially if you deal with a graph of associated objects. A common case is
            a parent/child relationship. Consider the following example:
        </para>

        <para>
            If the children in a parent/child relationship would be value typed (e.g. a collection
            of addresses or strings), their life cycle would depend on the parent and no
            further action would be required for convenient "cascading" of state changes.
            When the parent is saved, the value-typed child objects are saved and
            when the parent is deleted, the children will be deleted, etc. This
            works for operations such as the removal of a child from the collection.
            Since value-typed objects cannot have shared
            references, Hibernate will detect this and delete the child from the database.
        </para>

        <para>
            Now consider the same scenario with parent and child objects being entities,
            not value-types (e.g. categories and items, or parent and child cats). Entities
            have their own life cycle and support shared references.  Removing an entity from
            the collection does not mean it can be deleted), and there is by default no
            cascading of state from one entity to any other associated entities. Hibernate
            does not implement <emphasis>persistence by reachability</emphasis> by default.
        </para>

        <para>
            For each basic operation of the Hibernate session - including <literal>persist(), merge(),
            saveOrUpdate(), delete(), lock(), refresh(), evict(), replicate()</literal> - there is a 
            corresponding cascade style. Respectively, the cascade styles are named <literal>create, 
            merge, save-update, delete, lock, refresh, evict, replicate</literal>. If you want an 
            operation to be cascaded along an association, you must indicate that in the mapping
            document. For example:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<one-to-one name="person" cascade="persist"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Cascade styles my be combined:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<one-to-one name="person" cascade="persist,delete,lock"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            You can even use <literal>cascade="all"</literal> to specify that <emphasis>all</emphasis>
            operations should be cascaded along the association. The default <literal>cascade="none"</literal>
            specifies that no operations are to be cascaded.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            A special cascade style, <literal>delete-orphan</literal>, applies only to one-to-many
            associations, and indicates that the <literal>delete()</literal> operation should
            be applied to any child object that is removed from the association.

                    Otherwise, you might not need cascade at all. But if you think that you will often be
                    working with the parent and children together in the same transaction, and you want to save 
                    yourself some typing, consider using <literal>cascade="persist,merge,save-update"</literal>.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
            Mapping an association (either a single valued association, or a collection) with 
            <literal>cascade="all"</literal> marks the association as a 
            <emphasis>parent/child</emphasis> style relationship where save/update/delete of the 
            parent results in save/update/delete of the child or children.
        </para>
        <para>
            Furthermore, a mere reference to a child from a persistent parent will result in 
            save/update of the child. This metaphor is incomplete, however. A child which becomes 
            unreferenced by its parent is <emphasis>not</emphasis> automatically deleted, except 
            in the case of a <literal>&lt;one-to-many&gt;</literal> association mapped with
            <literal>cascade="delete-orphan"</literal>. The precise semantics of cascading

            This model can be useful to the application itself. For example, the application
