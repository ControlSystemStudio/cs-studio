    <title>Building from source and testing</title>

    <para>
        Envers, as a module of Hibernate, uses a standard Maven2 build. So all the usual
        build targets (compile, test, install) will work.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can check out the source code
        <ulink url="http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/hibernate/core/trunk/">from SVN</ulink>,
        or browse it using
        <ulink url="http://fisheye.jboss.org/browse/Hibernate">FishEye</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
        The tests use, by default, use a H2 in-memory database. The configuration
        file can be found in <literal>src/test/resources/hibernate.test.cfg.xml</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
        The tests use TestNG, and can be found in the
        <literal>org.hibernate.envers.test.integration</literal> package
        (or rather, in subpackages of this package).
        The tests aren't unit tests, as they don't test individual classes, but the behaviour
        and interaction of many classes, hence the name of package.
    </para>

    <para>
        A test normally consists of an entity (or two entities) that will be audited and extends the
        <literal>AbstractEntityTest</literal> class, which has one abstract method:
        <literal>configure(Ejb3Configuration)</literal>. The role of this method is to add the entities
        that will be used in the test to the configuration.
    </para>

    <para>
        The test data is in most cases created in the "initData" method (which is called once before
        the tests from this class are executed), which normally creates a couple of revisions,
        by persisting and updating entities. The tests first check if the revisions, in which
        entities where modified are correct (the testRevisionCounts method), and if the historic
        data is correct (the testHistoryOfXxx methods).
    </para>
