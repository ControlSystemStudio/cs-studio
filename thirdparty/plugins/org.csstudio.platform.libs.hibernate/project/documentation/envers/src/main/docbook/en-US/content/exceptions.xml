<chapter id="exceptions">
    <title>Mapping exceptions</title>

    <section id="exceptions-wontbesupported">

        <title>What isn't and will not be supported</title>

        <para>
            Bags (the corresponding Java type is List), as they can contain non-unique elements.
            The reason is that persisting, for example a bag of String-s, violates a principle
            of relational databases: that each table is a set of tuples. In case of bags,
            however (which require a join table), if there is a duplicate element, the two
            tuples corresponding to the elements will be the same. Hibernate allows this,
            however Envers (or more precisely: the database connector) will throw an exception
            when trying to persist two identical elements, because of a unique constraint violation.
        </para>

        <para>
            There are at least two ways out if you need bag semantics:
        </para>

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    use an indexed collection, with the <literal>@IndexColumn</literal> annotation, or
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    provide a unique id for your elements with the <literal>@CollectionId</literal> annotation.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

    </section>

    <section id="exceptions-willbesupported" revision="2">

        <title>What isn't and <emphasis>will</emphasis> be supported</title>

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    collections of components
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

    </section>

    <section id="exceptions-onetomanyjoincolumn" revision="3">

        <title><literal>@OneToMany</literal>+<literal>@JoinColumn</literal></title>

        <para>
            When a collection is mapped using these two annotations, Hibernate doesn't
            generate a join table. Envers, however, has to do this, so that when you read the
            revisions in which the related entity has changed, you don't get false results.
        </para>
        <para>
            To be able to name the additional join table, there is a special annotation:
            <literal>@AuditJoinTable</literal>, which has similar semantics to JPA's
            <literal>@JoinTable</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
            One special case are relations mapped with <literal>@OneToMany</literal>+<literal>@JoinColumn</literal> on
            the one side, and <literal>@ManyToOne</literal>+<literal>@JoinColumn(insertable=false, updatable=false</literal>)
            on the many side.
            Such relations are in fact bidirectional, but the owning side is the collection (see alse
            <ulink url="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/annotations/reference/en/html_single/#entity-hibspec-collection-extratype">here</ulink>).
        </para>
        <para>
            To properly audit such relations with Envers, you can use the <literal>@AuditMappedBy</literal> annotation.
            It enables you to specify the reverse property (using the <literal>mappedBy</literal> element). In case
            of indexed collections, the index column must also be mapped in the referenced entity (using
            <literal>@Column(insertable=false, updatable=false)</literal>, and specified using
            <literal>positionMappedBy</literal>. This annotation will affect only the way
            Envers works. Please note that the annotation is experimental and may change in the future.
