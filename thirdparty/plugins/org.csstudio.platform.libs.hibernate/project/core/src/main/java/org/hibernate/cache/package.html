            This package defines APIs/SPIs and implementations for the Hibernate second-level cache.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legacy (and now deprecated) approach to caching is defined by the {@link org.hibernate.cache.CacheProvider} and
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.Cache} interfaces as well as the {@link org.hibernate.cache.CacheConcurrencyStrategy}
            interface along with the various implementations of all these interfaces.  In that scheme, a
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.CacheProvider} defined how to configure and perform lifecycle operations
            in regards to a particular underlying caching library; it also defined how to build {@link org.hibernate.cache.Cache}
            instances which in turn defined how to access the "regions" of the underlying cache instance.
            For entity and collection data cache regions, {@link org.hibernate.cache.CacheConcurrencyStrategy} wrapped
            access to those cache regions to apply transactional/concurrent access semantics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The improved approach is based on {@link org.hibernate.cache.RegionFactory}, the various
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.Region} specializations and the two access strategies contracts
            ({@link org.hibernate.cache.access.EntityRegionAccessStrategy} and
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.access.CollectionRegionAccessStrategy}).  The general approach here is that
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.RegionFactory} defined how to configure and perform lifecycle operations
            in regards to a particular underlying caching library (<b>or libraries</b>).
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.RegionFactory} also defines how to build specialized
            {@link org.hibernate.cache.Region} instances based on the type of data we will be storing in that given
            region.  The fact that {@link org.hibernate.cache.RegionFactory} is asked to build <b>specialized</b>
            regions (as opposed to just general access) is the first <i>improvement</i> over the legacy scheme.  The
            second <i>improvement</i> is the fact that the regions (well the ones like entity and collection regions
            that are responsible for storing {@link org.hibernate.cache.TransactionalDataRegion transactional} data) are
            asked to build their own access strategies (see {@link org.hibernate.cache.EntityRegion#buildAccessStrategy}
            and {@link org.hibernate.cache.CollectionRegion#buildAccessStrategy}).
