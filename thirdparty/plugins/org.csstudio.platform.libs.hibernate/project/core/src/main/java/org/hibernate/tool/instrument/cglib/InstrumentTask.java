/**
 * An Ant task for instrumenting persistent classes in order to enable
 * field-level interception using CGLIB.
 * <p/>
 * In order to use this task, typically you would define a a taskdef
 * similar to:<pre>
 * <taskdef name="instrument" classname="org.hibernate.tool.instrument.cglib.InstrumentTask">
 *     <classpath refid="lib.class.path"/>
 * </taskdef>
 * </pre>
 * where <tt>lib.class.path</tt> is an ANT path reference containing all the
 * required Hibernate and CGLIB libraries.
 * <p/>
 * And then use it like:<pre>
 * <instrument>
 *     <fileset dir="${testclasses.dir}/org/hibernate/test">
 *         <include name="yadda/yadda/**"/>
 *         ...
 *     </fileset>
 * </instrument>
 * </pre>
 * where the nested ANT fileset includes the class you would like to have
 * instrumented.
 * <p/>
 * Optionally you can chose to enable "Extended Instrumentation" if desired
 * by specifying the extended attribute on the task:<pre>
 * <instrument extended="true">
 *     ...
 * </instrument>
 * </pre>
 * See the Hibernate manual regarding this option.
