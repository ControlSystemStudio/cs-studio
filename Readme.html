Pure java version of the EPICS ChannelAccess client library,
with Eclipse preference page for basic configuration.
<p>
See org.csstudio.utility.pv for a utility wrapper.

Note that this includes only the pure Java client code.
In addition, one typically also needs the 'caRepeater'.
This code does not include the very latest, pure java CA repeater,
so you probably have to launch the 'native' version of the
repeater for e.g. Win32 yourself before running a CSS app
that uses the CA client library.
