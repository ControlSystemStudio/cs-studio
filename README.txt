This plugin provides EPICS ChannelAccess libraries,
initializing their settings from Eclipse preferences.
For GUI Applications, consider adding org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics.ui.

* JCA
.. is the basic Java Channel Access API, including an implementation
that uses the original EPICS libraries via JNI.

* CAJ
.. is a pure Java implementation of the JCA API.

* Specific build instructions

jca-2.3.3.jar
-------------
Built from 2009/09/14 source snapshot from http://epics-jca.sourceforge.net.

Set EPICS_BASE_RELEASE, HOST_ARCH, EPICS_HOST_ARCH as required to build
EPICS base.

  cd where-org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics-is-located
  tar vzxf org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/lib/jca-2.3.3.tgz
  cd jca-2.3.3
  ant
  
This creates two items of interest:
1) Java library O.core/jca.jar, copy to jca-2.3.3.jar in plugin's lib subdir
2) OS-specific JNI lib like O.linux-x86/libjca.so, which typically
   should be re-linked as described below and then placed into the corresponding
   lib/<OS>/<CPU> subdir.

- Mac OS X binary -
Created on Intel OS X 10.5.8 with EPICS base R3.14.11 (with epicsExit.c fix),
java 1.5.0_24.

The 'ant' build ends like this:
  g++ -L/Kram/epics/R3.14.9/base/lib/darwin-x86 -lca -lCom -framework JavaVM \
   -arch i386 -dynamiclib -Wl,-single_module \
   -o /Kram/Eclipse/Workspace/jca-2.3.2/O.darwin-x86/libjca.jnilib \
   /Kram/Eclipse/Workspace/jca-2.3.2/O.darwin-x86/JNI.o
   
   
  g++ -L/Kram/epics/R3.14.11/base/lib/darwin-x86 -lca -lCom -framework JavaVM \
    -arch i386 -dynamiclib -Wl,-single_module \
    -o /Kram/MerurialRepos/jca-2.3.3/O.darwin-x86/libjca.jnilib \
    /Kram/MerurialRepos/jca-2.3.3/O.darwin-x86/JNI.o
   
... which resulted in a shared library with further shared lib dependencies:
otool -L O.darwin-x86/libjca.jnilib 
O.darwin-x86/libjca.jnilib:
    ...
	/Kram/epics/R3.14.11/base/lib/darwin-x86/libca.3.14.11.dylib ...
	/Kram/epics/R3.14.11/base/lib/darwin-x86/libCom.3.14.11.dylib ...
    ...

Manually issuing the following command creates a JCA JNI lib with only
"system" dependencies, no remaining EPICS shared lib dependecies:

LIB=$EPICS_BASE_RELEASE/lib/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH
g++ -framework JavaVM -arch i386 -dynamiclib -Wl,-single_module -o O.darwin-x86/libjca.jnilib \
    O.darwin-x86/JNI.o $LIB/libCom.a $LIB/libca.a 
cp O.darwin-x86/libjca.jnilib ....../cs-studio/core/plugins/org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/lib/macosx/x86/libjca.jnilib

- Linux X86 binary -
Created on Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update 8)
2.6.9-89.0.26.ELsmp
g++ (GCC) 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-11)
with EPICS base R3.14.11
JDK 1.5.0_17

Similar to the OS X binary, the JNI lib was linked without
further dependencies on shared EPICS base libraries:

cd O.linux-x86
LIB=$EPICS_BASE_RELEASE/lib/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH
g++ -shared -lpthread -lreadline  -lncurses -lm -lrt -Wl,-rpath,. -o libjca.so JNI.o $LIB/libca.a $LIB/libCom.a
# Check:
readelf -d libjca.so 
cp libjca.so ../../org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/lib/linux/x86
  
caj-1.1.6.jar
--------------
Built from included 2009/09/13 source snapshot from http://epics-jca.sourceforge.net,
where build.xml was changed to set debug="true" for javac,
and src/com/cosylab/epics/caj/util/nif/InetAddressUtilV6.java was renamed to *.java6 to
allow compilation with both Java 1.5 and 6.

Created on Intel OS X 10.5.8, java 1.5.0_24.

tar vzxf org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/lib/caj-1.1.6.tgz 
cd caj-1.1.6
# Maybe edit build.xml, adjust this section:
   <path id="build.classpath">
        <pathelement location="../org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/lib/jca-2.3.2.jar"/>
   </path>
ant

Copy target/caj.jar ....../org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/lib/caj-1.1.6.jar




Older stuff:
jca-2.3.2.jar was built from jca-2.3.2 sources with the following changes:
src/core/gov/aps/jca/jni/JNI.cpp, line 1112
  // KUK, Mar 31 2009: Leaked memory from ....addMonitor()
  delete ((MonitorID*)monitorID);

jca-2.3.1.jar was built from the jca-2.3.1 sources with the following changes:
- Updated ThreadSafeContext.java. Based on findings by Tom Pelaia and
  Kay Kasemir, the pause() call in the run() loop was replaced by a blocking
  queue. The original implementation would be quite slow on fast CPUs(!)
  because the code would sit in pause() instead of handling requests.
  Now it wakes immediately when new requests arrive.
- JNITargetArch.java checks for Mac OS X handled osarch="ppc" and "x86",
  but latest Intel Macs seem to report "i386", which is now handled as well.
