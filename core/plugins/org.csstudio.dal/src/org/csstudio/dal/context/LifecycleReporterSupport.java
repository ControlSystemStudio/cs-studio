/**
 * <code>LifecycleReporterSupport</code> is convenience implementation of
 * <code>LifecycleReporter</code>. Supports fireing
 * <code>LifecycleEvent</code> objects with default <code>fire()</code> event
 * and with <code>fire(LifecycleEvent)</code> custom event. Each time fire
 * method is invoked this class first checkes if it is in appropriate
 * lifecycle phase. If it's not, than <code>IllegalStateException</code> is
 * thrown. If this class is in correct phase, the phase is advanced to the
 * next phase (see LifecycleReporter for details) and event is propagated to
 * listeners.
