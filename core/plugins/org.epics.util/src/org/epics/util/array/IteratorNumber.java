/**
 * An iterator for a stream of primitive numbers, which allows to retrieve
 * the value casted in the type you prefer. This class allows to implement
 * a single binding for iterating over a collection instead of six different
 * binding. If the original type is required, instanceof can be used to
 * differentiate between {@link IteratorByte}, {@link IteratorShort}, 
 * {@link IteratorInt}, {@link IteratorLong}, {@link IteratorFloat} and 
 * {@link IteratorDouble}.
 * <p>
 * We looked into making this class implement Iterator, but unfortunately,
 * because of generics being invariant, we cannot provide a scheme that would work naturally
 * in all cases. Ideally, we would want to have {@code IteratorNumber} be {@code Iterator<Number>}
 * and {@code IteratorDouble} be {@code Iterator<Double>}, but this does
 * not work because generics are invariant. We could have
 * {@code Iterator<T extends Number>} and {@code Iterator<Double>}, but that would
 * mean {@code IteratorNumber} would need a type parameter, and the user of the
 * API would have to use bound type parameters like {@code IteratorNumber<? extends Number>},
 * which is awful. We could have all extend {@code Iterator<Number>} but then
 * the foreach loops would return {@code Number} in all cases, even for collections
 * of more specific type.
