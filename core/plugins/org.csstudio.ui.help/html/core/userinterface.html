    <h2>Basic Terms And Concepts</h2>
	<p>The  Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the Control System Studio is based upon the following concepts:</p>
	<p>
	  <br/>
	  <em>Views</em><br />
	  A view is a window-like UI element that typically provides  a &ldquo;view&rdquo; on data. The Control System Studio and its applications provide various views. 
	  They are resizeable and can be freely arranged within the CSS main window. Views may provide toolbars that you can use to configure the view. 
	  If you stack views on top of each other you can select the top view by clicking on its tab. Despite their name, views can be used to change the displayed data. 
	  Every change to an item of a view is saved immediately.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><em>E</em><em>ditors</em><br />
    An editor is typically used to &ldquo;edit&rdquo; the data it displays. It shares many features with views. 
    The main difference between views and editors is that an editor saves changes to its items only when you explicitly choose to save. 
    There is only one place in the CSS main window where editors can appear. This place is called &ldquo;editor area&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><em>Perspectives</em><br />
    A perspective defines an arrangement of various views. Certain menu or toolbar entries can be associated to a perspective.</p>
