 * Severity of an alarm.
 * <p>
 * Values are provided in order of increasing severity, so you can rely on
 * {@link #ordinal() } and {@link #compareTo(java.lang.Enum) } for comparison
 * and ordering. In case additional AlarmSeverity values are added in the future,
 * which is very unlikely, they will be added in order as well.
 * <p>
 * One should always bear in mind that the alarm severity of the IOC is set on
 * the record, and not on the individual channel. If  one is not connecting
 * to the value field of the record, the severity does not reflect the state
 * of that field.
 * <p>
 * For example: a record may be INVALID meaning that the value of the field
 * was not correctly read by the hardware; if one connects to the display limit
 * field, the value of that field will still be ok, but the alarm severity (if
 * requested) would say INVALID.
