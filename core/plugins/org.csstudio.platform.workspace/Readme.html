<h1>Workspace Utils</h1>

Code for selecting and switching the workspace.
This is mostly adapted from
org.eclipse.ui.ide, where some 
org.eclipse.ui.internal code was not accessible
to ordinary applications.
<p>

Alexander Will had previously provided something
very much like this within org.csstudio.platform.ui,
but that leads to problems:<br>

When loading the CSS platform plugin, it reads certain
preferences. That in turn activates the default workspace.
When invoking a "Workspace Select" dialog from the
CSS platform plugin, there is consequently already
a workspace active, and one cannot select the one that
the user picked in the "Workspace Select" dialog.
The only way out is a restart as performed in the 
SwitchWorkspaceAction, but that takes a long time.
<p>

This plugin is therefore as much as possible standalone,
so that applications can prompt for a workspace and then
select it.
The org.csstudio.sns.product will show an example of
using it in a way similar to the IDE.
