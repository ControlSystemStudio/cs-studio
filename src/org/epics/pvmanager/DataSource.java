 * A source for data that is going to be processed by the PVManager.

 * for each different source can be added by external libraries.
 * <p>
 * To implement a datasource, one has to implement the {@link #createChannel(java.lang.String) }
 * method, and the requested will be forwarded to the channel accordingly.
 * The channels are automatically cached and reused. The name under which
 * the channels are looked up in the cache or registered in the cache is configurable.
 * <p>
 * Channel handlers can be implemented from scratch, or one can use the {@link MultiplexedChannelHandler}
 * for handlers that want to open a single connection which is going to be
 * shared by all readers and writers.
