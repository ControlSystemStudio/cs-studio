/**
 * Implements the mechanism for registering different types so that the library
 * knows how to handle them.
 * <p>
 * For a type to be usable by the library it needs to be defined:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>How to copy - since values given to the UI should be modified only
 *   within the UI thread, it follows that new values cannot be prepared
 *   "in place", on the same object that was given to the UI. At notification,
 *   there will be then two copies, the old and the new, and in need to be clear
 *   how the new copy should be delivered. (e.g. just pass the new copy, modify
 *   the old object in place, etc...).</li>
 *   <li>When to notify - by comparing elements of the value, it should
 *   decide on what condition the old value need to be modified and the
 *   UI should be notified of the change.</li>
 * </ul>
